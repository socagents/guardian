"""Container-side shim that mimics guardian-agent's
`bundles/spark/mcp/src/config/config.py` interface.

Connector code (e.g. `bundles/spark/connectors/web/src/browser.py`)
imports from this module:

    from config.config import get_config

In guardian-agent, that resolves to a real Settings + ConfigProxy
backed by env vars + per-instance contextvar overrides. In a
connector container, the only thing that matters is "get the
instance-config blob" — there are no env-var Settings to fall back
to, because the container was started with all the per-instance
values already known. This shim provides that minimal surface.

# Public API (mirrored from the agent's config.config):

    get_config()               → returns _ConfigProxy with instance values
    set_current_instance(d)    → set the contextvar to dict d, returns token
    reset_current_instance(t)  → reset via the returned token

# What the agent's version does that this DOESN'T

  - No Settings class. The container has no env-var-derived defaults
    because everything per-instance was loaded into the contextvar
    by the runtime entrypoint at boot.
  - No reload_config(). Runtime config is fixed at container start;
    operators reconfigure by stopping + restarting the container
    (which is what guardian-updater does on edit-instance).
  - No `_ConfigProxy` fall-through to underlying Settings — if a key
    isn't in the instance overrides, attribute access raises.
    Connector code that needs a default should use
    `getattr(cfg, key, default)` (which the existing connectors
    already do; see browser.py:_instance_config).

Raising on missing-key is intentional: if a connector tries to read
`config.x` and `x` isn't in the instance row, that's a bug in the
connector or a stale instance. Better to surface it loudly than
silently fall through to None.
