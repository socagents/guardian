"""Read-only InstanceStore client for per-instance connector containers.

Looks up a single instance row from `<data_root>/instances.db` by
INSTANCE_ID at boot. Returns the instance's config dict + secret_refs
dict (as stored by guardian-agent) so the runtime can:

  1. Resolve secret_refs through SecretStoreReader,
  2. Build a flattened {config + resolved_secrets} blob,
  3. Stash it on the contextvar shim that connector code reads via
     `from config.config import get_config`.

# Why a thin reader vs vendoring the full InstanceStore class

Same reasoning as SecretStoreReader: the agent's full InstanceStore
is ~620 lines covering CRUD, audit hooks, listing, secret-store
coupling, and migration logic. The runtime container only needs the
single-row READ path. Vendoring would drag in the whole transitive
dep tree for a 20-line SELECT.

# On-disk schema (as defined by InstanceStore._init_schema):
  CREATE TABLE instances (
      id           TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      connector_id TEXT NOT NULL,
      name         TEXT NOT NULL,
      config       TEXT NOT NULL,    -- JSON
      secret_refs  TEXT NOT NULL,    -- JSON
      created_at   TEXT NOT NULL,
      enabled      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
  );

The reader is locked to this schema. If the agent's InstanceStore
adds columns, this client either picks them up via SELECT * (if
they have defaults) or surfaces an explicit error if they don't.
The runtime image and guardian-agent always ship from the same
release tag, so schema drift is bounded by release boundaries.

# Why read-only

The connector container has no business writing to the instance
store — that's an agent-side operator concern (creating, editing,
deleting instances goes through the agent's UI + REST). Read-only
mount of `guardian_mcp_data` (or wherever instances.db lives) is a
defense-in-depth: even if a connector is compromised, it can't
mutate the agent's source of truth for what's deployed.
