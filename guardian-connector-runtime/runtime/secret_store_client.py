"""Read-only SecretStore client for per-instance connector containers.

Mirrors the on-disk crypto envelope used by guardian-agent's
SecretStore (bundles/spark/mcp/src/usecase/secret_store.py) so a
connector container reading from the same `guardian_secret_store`
volume sees identical plaintext.

# Why a thin reader instead of vendoring the full SecretStore class

The agent's full SecretStore is ~580 lines and pulls in audit_log,
instance_store, several other usecase modules. The runtime container
only needs the READ + DECRYPT path — no writes, no migrations, no
list-under, no audit hooks. Vendoring the full class would drag in
the whole transitive dep tree for a 30-line crypto operation.

The trade-off: this reader is locked to v1 envelope format. If the
agent's SecretStore ever bumps to v2 (different cipher, different
header), this reader breaks. Mitigation: same major+minor version of
guardian-agent and guardian-connector-runtime always ship from the same
release tag, so the envelope format is implicitly aligned. A v2
envelope would land in BOTH at the same version, with a coordinated
migration step.

# On-disk envelope format (v1, matches secret_store.py:108-114):
  ENVELOPE_HEADER (3 bytes b"v1\x00")
  + nonce (12 bytes)
  + ciphertext + GCM tag (variable)
  All wrapped in base64 to keep files UTF-8 readable for tooling.

KEK_ENV_VAR is the same `GUARDIAN_SECRET_KEK` the agent uses; the
operator sets it once on the host's docker-compose env and it's
passed to BOTH guardian-agent and connector containers via env-var
inheritance.
