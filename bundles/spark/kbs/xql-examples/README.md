# XQL Examples Knowledge Base

This directory is the bundled `xql-examples` knowledge base — one of the platform's bundled KBs declared in `bundles/spark/manifest.yaml:knowledge.bundled[]`. The runtime's `SqliteKnowledgeBase` (spec §6.10 standalone impl, see `bundles/spark/mcp/src/usecase/kb_store.py`) ingests every markdown file under `entries/`, embeds each entry's content + title via `text-embedding-004`, and serves semantic search via the runtime's built-in `knowledge_search` tool. The `xsiam` connector exposes a thin back-compat wrapper at `find_xql_examples_rag(intent, top_k)` that delegates here.

## Adding a new entry

Each entry is a single markdown file under `entries/` with YAML frontmatter validated against `schema.json`. Required fields: `id`, `title`, `category`. Optional fields: `dataset`, `tags`.

Filename convention: `<NNN>-<kebab-case-slug>.md`. `NNN` is a zero-padded sequence number — pick the next available; the schema validation is keyed on the `id` field, not the filename, so collisions in numbering are caught at boot.

```yaml
---
id: XQL-NNN-<short-slug>
title: <Human-readable title — describes the analyst intent, since the embedder includes this in the searchable content>
category: alert-mapping | detection | investigation | general
dataset: <xsiam dataset name, e.g. "xdr_data" or "panw_ngfw_traffic_raw">
tags:
  - <pipeline stages used: filter, comp, alter, dedup, sort, ...>
  - <free-form: xdr_data, network, causality, etc.>
---

# <Title>

**Dataset**: `<dataset name>`

\`\`\`sql
<the full XQL query — multi-line ok>
\`\`\`

## When to use

<one-paragraph description of the operator-facing use case>

## Variations

<numbered or bulleted list of common parameter changes — different time windows, alternative datasets, additional filters>

## Source

<one-line attribution — operator-validated date, vendor doc citation, etc.>
```

## Validation discipline (v0.5.72+)

Entries fall into three confidence buckets — the operator's expectation differs per bucket:

1. **Operator-validated** — the query was run against a real XDR/XSIAM tenant by the operator (or by the agent driving the connector) and returned correct results. The `## Source` section names the tenant or scenario (e.g. `Validated 2026-05-17 against tenant=lab-1, scenario=v0.5.57 phantom-killchain`). These are the gold-standard entries; they're "we know this works."

2. **Vendor-documented** — the query is a documented pattern from Palo Alto's official Cortex XQL / XDR Public API documentation (e.g. accessed via the `cortex-docs` connector). The `## Source` cites the vendor doc and notes "Validate against your tenant before relying." These cover well-established XQL patterns that any tenant should accept, but tenant-specific schema quirks can still break field names.

3. **Pattern derived** — XQL patterns inferred from the connector tool descriptions, related queries in the corpus, or general SIEM hunting know-how. The `## Source` says "Pattern derived from..." and is explicit that the operator should validate before relying. Use this bucket sparingly; the goal of the KB is "queries we know work," and overpopulating with pattern-derived entries dilutes signal.

Don't add tenant-specific field names without redaction. If a query references a custom dataset only your tenant has, mark it as `(tenant-specific)` in the title.

## After adding entries

The `xql-examples` index is regenerated on agent boot when the runtime's KB store detects any entry file with a newer mtime than the indexed copy. No manual reindex command is required — restart the agent container (or wait for the next boot) and the new entries become searchable. The audit row recording the reindex appears in `/observability/events` with `audit_type=knowledge_indexed`.

To verify locally:

```bash
# After saving new entries, restart the agent container:
docker compose restart phantom-agent

# Then check that knowledge_search returns the new entry:
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/knowledge_search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCP_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"kb_name": "xql-examples", "query": "<a phrase from your new title>"}' \
  | jq '.data.results[] | {id, title}'
```
