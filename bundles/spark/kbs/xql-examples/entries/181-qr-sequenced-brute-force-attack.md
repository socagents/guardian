## When to use

Sequenced Brute Force Attack. Queries the `xdr_data` dataset directly, filtered on `event_type=ENUM.EVENT_LOG AND action_evtlog_event_id = 4625`. Uses stages: `filter`, `alter`, `bin`, `comp`, `sort`, `join`.

## Variations

_(Auto-imported — variations not yet authored. The operator's curation pass adds these.)_

The `When to use` description above was auto-generated by the importer's heuristic — operator-curation pass pending.
