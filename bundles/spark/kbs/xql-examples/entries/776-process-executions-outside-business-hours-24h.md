# Process executions outside business hours (24h)

**Dataset**: `xdr_data`

```sql
config timeframe = 24h
| dataset = xdr_data
| filter event_type = ENUM.PROCESS and event_sub_type = ENUM.PROCESS_START
| alter hour_of_day = format_timestamp("%H", _time)
| filter hour_of_day in ("00", "01", "02", "03", "04", "05", "22", "23")
| comp count() as cnt by agent_hostname, action_process_image_name, actor_effective_username
| sort desc cnt
| limit 10
```

## When to use

Process executions during off-hours (22:00-05:00). Uses `format_timestamp` to extract the hour. After-hours activity by interactive users is a common compromise indicator.

## Variations

_(v0.7.0 hand-curated — variations not yet authored. Operator's
curation pass adds these.)_

## Source

Hand-curated for v0.7.0's 100-query KB expansion. Validated against
the operator's live XDR tenant before being written to this file:
the query body was POSTed to `xdr_run_xql_query` and returned
`status: SUCCESS` (any row count, including 0). The `## When to use`
description above was hand-written to match the operator-language
norms of the existing KB.
