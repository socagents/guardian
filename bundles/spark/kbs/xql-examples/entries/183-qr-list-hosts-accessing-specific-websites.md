# QR- List hosts accessing specific websites

**Dataset**: `xdr_data`

```sql
//Title: List hosts accessing specific websites
//Description: This query searches for hosts accessing certain sites. There are filters for some quick win hacking/lateral movement/exfil tools by default. Users can add specific IOCs as needed.
//Author: Sanket Shah, Greg Overton, Raymond DePalma (updated Alexis Mack)
//Technical QC: Cooper Allen
//Date: May 7, 2023
//Dataset: xdr_data events//Requirements: Endpoints must have the Cortex XDR agent installed, and events must have occurred since installation. Agent must have checked in (come online) since events occurred for events to appear in dataset.
//Tags: EDR,AllOS,MedFi,IRKO,PANWOpen, CA_Network
