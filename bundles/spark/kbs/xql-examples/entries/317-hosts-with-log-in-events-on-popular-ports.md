# Hosts with Log in Events on Popular Ports

**Dataset**: `xdr_login_events`

```sql
preset = xdr_login_events
| filter agent_hostname in($host)
| filter (action_local_port in (22, 23, 445, 3389))
| fields agent_hostname, agent_ip_addresses, actor_effective_username, action_local_ip, action_local_port, action_remote_ip, action_remote_port,*
```
