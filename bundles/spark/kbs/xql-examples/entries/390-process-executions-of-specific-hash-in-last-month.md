| filter action_process_image_sha256 = $hash or action_process_image_md5 = $hash or action_file_sha256 = $hash or action_module_sha256 = $hash
| fields _time, agent_hostname,event_type, event_sub_type, actor_effective_username , action_process_image_path, action_process_image_sha256, action_process_image_md5, actor_process_image_name , action_file_path

Searches for the given hash, and lists all the events in the last month where this hash was executed and observed by the XDR agent. This can help identify the endpoints which have executed a suspicous file/malware
