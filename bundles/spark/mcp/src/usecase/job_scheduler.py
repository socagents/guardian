"""CroniterJobScheduler — bundle-local implementation of the spec's
`scheduling` capability (spec.md §6.10 row "scheduling").

Per spec §6.10, `scheduling` has two backend impls:

  - **Standalone**: `CroniterJobScheduler` — a single asyncio task
                    that walks `manifest.yaml:jobs[]` and fires each
                    job's action when its cron expression is due.
  - **Platform**:   `KubernetesCronJobScheduler` — the platform's
                    central cron controller materializes one Kubernetes
                    `CronJob` per declared job and routes its output
                    back through the agent runtime.

This module is the standalone variant. It composes cleanly with
Phases 6-8: when a cron fires `xsiam.run_xql_query`, the
dispatch goes through the SAME wrapped tool callable the agent uses,
so audit, approvals, and instance contextvar all apply uniformly.

# State split: manifest vs sqlite

  - `manifest.yaml:jobs[]` is the **source of truth for cron
    definitions**. Editing the manifest requires a redeploy/reboot;
    that's intentional — cron schedules are infra config, not runtime
    settings.
  - `<data_root>/jobs.db` holds **runtime mutable state**: per-job
    `enabled` flag (operators can pause without editing manifest) and
    the `last_fired_at`/`last_status`/`next_due_at` history. Plus a
    `job_runs` table keyed to each fire for "show me last N runs of
    job X" forensics.

When the manifest changes, on next boot the scheduler reconciles:
new jobs get inserted with enabled=1; jobs that disappeared from the
manifest are marked `removed=1` (kept for historical run records but
never fired again).

        scheduler call carries neither, so it authenticates with the
        container's MCP_TOKEN as an internal-service bearer (v0.17.126) —
        the same loopback trust the /api/agent/internal/* routes use. The
        agent's route handlers still attach MCP_TOKEN themselves when they
        call the embedded MCP downstream.

        Streams the SSE response, accumulates `text_delta` and
        `tool_call`/`tool_result` frames into a structured result, and
        returns when the `done` event arrives. Errors propagate to the
        runner's catch block which records status=failure.

        The session_id is auto-created by the chat route when omitted —
        we let it pick a fresh one so each scheduled run is its own
        session, browseable in the chat sidebar like any other.

        v0.5.22 / Issue #22: when `model_id` is set, the request body
        includes `model: <id>` so the chat route's resolveModelName()
        picks it over runtimeConfig.GEMINI_MODEL. When `thinking_enabled`
        is True, the body also carries `thinking: true` — the chat
        route forwards that to the model provider's thinkingConfig (no-
        op on flash variants, honored on pro variants).

        v0.1.27: when `bypass_approvals=True`, the request carries
        `X-Phantom-Approval-Bypass: 1` so the MCP-side gate auto-
        approves any humanRequired[] tools the agent calls during the
        job. Operators set this per-job via the job edit form. The
        chat route forwards the header onto every downstream MCP
        call (see PhantomMCPClient's extraHeaders) so the contextvar

# Tool dispatcher factory — Phase 9b.
#
# The scheduler dispatches tool calls through `fastmcp.Client`
# pointed at the in-process FastMCP instance. This is the SAME
# JSON-RPC marshalling pipeline the LLM-driven agent uses:
#
#   1. Pydantic schema marshalling — `kwargs` get validated and
#      assembled into the tool's request model
#   2. Context injection — fastmcp constructs a `Context` carrying
#      the lifespan context (instance config from the Phase-5
#      contextvar, etc.) and passes it as `ctx`
#   3. Result normalization — the `CallToolResult` we get back
#      already has structured_content, content, and isError fields
#
# Phase 9 v1 used `fn(**kwargs)` directly which only worked for
# kwargs-style built-in tools (memory_search, sessions_list); any
# connector tool with the canonical FastMCP signature
# `(request: PydanticModel, ctx: Context)` failed with a TypeError.
# This is the proper fix that lets us schedule any tool the agent
# can call — connector tools and built-ins alike.

    When `mcp` is None (test harness, embedded use without a server),
