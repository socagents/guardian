"""Phase-12 closed-loop coverage tools.

Surface for the agent to:

  - Pull XSIAM issues into a local detection inventory
    (`detections_sync`)
  - Read what fired, when, against which technique
    (`detections_list`, `detections_get`)
  - Take point-in-time snapshots of the inventory state
    (`coverage_snapshot_take`)        ← Commit 2
  - Diff snapshots to detect drift (silent rules, new gaps)
    (`coverage_diff`, `coverage_gaps`) ← Commit 2

This module ships the read + sync surface in Commit 1; the snapshot
+ drift surface lands in Commit 2. The split keeps each commit
independently CI-verifiable.

# Why these are built-in (not connector tools)

They aggregate XSIAM-side data (via the existing xsiam.get_issues
connector tool) into a phantom-local store. The aggregation, the
schema, and the drift-detection logic are all phantom concerns —
they live in the agent runtime regardless of which detection
backend (XSIAM, future Sentinel, Splunk, etc.) the operator has
configured. Putting them in `builtin_components/` gives the agent
a stable tool surface independent of connector churn.

# Approval gating

None of these tools mutate operator-visible state outside the
inventory DB. They're effectively reads + caching writes, so they
DON'T appear in manifest.approvals.humanRequired[]. The expensive
side-effect — calling XSIAM's PAPI — is rate-limited by the
existing fetcher.

# COMMIT 4 — closed-loop orchestrator
#
# `coverage_cycle_run` is the tool the manifest's
# `continuous-coverage-cycle` scheduled job invokes. It does in one
# pass what the chat-driven flow does in 6 tool calls:
#
#   1. Look up the active xsiam instance from the InstanceStore.
#   2. Resolve secrets via the bound SecretStore.
#   3. POST directly to XSIAM PAPI /issue/search/ with the time
#      window filter (default last 24h).
#   4. Upsert the issues into the detection inventory.
#   5. Take a coverage snapshot labeled `scheduler:cycle`.
#   6. If we have a previous snapshot, compute drift via
#      coverage_diff. Audit-log on non-zero signals.
#   7. Run coverage_gaps and audit-log on non-zero gap signals.
#   8. If drift or gap signals fired, publish an operator
#      notification with the headline counts.
#
# # Why direct PAPI vs going through the connector tool wrapper
#
# The connector wrapper (_wrap_with_instance) sets a per-call
# instance contextvar so connector tools resolve their config + auth
# at runtime. Invoking it from inside another in-process tool would
# require setting up that contextvar manually. Cleaner to bypass the
# wrapper: we already have the InstanceStore singleton, we already
# have the SecretStore reference (via InstanceStore.secret_store),
# and the PAPI request is two HTTP headers + a JSON body. The
# connector's xsiam_get_issues function still exists for chat-driven
# use; this tool just doesn't go through it.
