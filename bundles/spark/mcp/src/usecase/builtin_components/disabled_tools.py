"""Tools temporarily removed from MCP registration.

NOTE: This module is documentation-only — it isn't imported by main.py
or registered with the MCP server. Phase 2B moved the underlying tool
source into `bundles/spark/connectors/<id>/src/`, so the imports below
now point at the new bundle paths. Many of the tools listed here are
in fact registered today (the spec.tools[] in each connector.yaml is
broader than what was originally listed as "disabled"); keep this file
as a record of what was in flux but treat the connector.yaml files as
the source of truth.
