"""Operator workflow state — sqlite-backed canonical home (v0.5.1).

Holds the operator's UI workflow state that's NOT a UI preference and
should follow them across devices + survive volume operations:

  * tested_journeys — which journey ids the operator has marked tested
    on /help/journeys. Pre-v0.5.1 lived in localStorage under
    `phantom.help.tested-journeys`; survived volume wipes and didn't
    sync across browsers, violating both the operator's mental model
    and v0.4.0's canonical-state discipline (Rule 1: one state surface
    = one storage home).

  * metrics_bookmarks — saved metric queries on /observability/metrics.
    Pre-v0.5.1 lived in localStorage under
    `spark.observability.metrics.bookmarks.v1` with the same drawbacks.

# What this store does NOT hold

It's specifically for OPERATOR WORKFLOW STATE — facts the operator
wants to track that aren't bound to a single device. Things that DO
NOT belong here:

  * UI preferences (theme, sidebar collapsed, debug panel open). Those
    legitimately live in localStorage — device-local state for the
    chrome around the platform. See use-theme.ts + sidebar.tsx + the
    help-page sidebar toggles for the keep-in-localStorage examples.
  * Operator credentials. SecretStore handles those (v0.4.0 contract).
  * Connector / instance state. marketplace.db + instances.db (v0.5.0).
  * Auth sessions. auth_sessions.db (v0.4.0).
  * Agent self-modification state. Each subsystem owns its own store
    (memory_store, agent_definition_store, etc.).

This store is intentionally narrow: a key-value table where the value
is an opaque JSON blob the hook owns. Adding a new operator workflow
concern doesn't require a schema migration — just pick a new key.

# Schema

    operator_state(
      key         TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      value_json  TEXT NOT NULL,     -- arbitrary JSON serialized by the caller
      updated_at  TEXT NOT NULL      -- ISO 8601 UTC
    );

`key` is a stable identifier the caller picks (e.g. 'tested_journeys').
Suggested naming: lowercase + snake_case, ASCII only. The store does
NOT enforce a particular shape on value_json — that's a hook-level
concern. Each hook documents what shape it stores.

# Multi-user readiness

Today phantom is single-user (one admin per v0.4.0). The schema has
no `user_id` column because there's exactly one user. When multi-user
lands (v0.4.0 roadmap), add `user_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'admin'` +
move PRIMARY KEY to `(user_id, key)`. All existing rows migrate
cleanly with the DEFAULT clause; the API layer changes from "get the
authenticated MCP_TOKEN owner" (currently always admin) to "filter
rows by the resolved user_id from the session token." Same migration
shape v0.4.0 used for `sessions` (one user today, multi-user-ready
schema).

# Concurrency

Same pattern as marketplace_store.py: module-level RLock guards every
SQLite operation; short-lived connections per call; WAL journal mode.
