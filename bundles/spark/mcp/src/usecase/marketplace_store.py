"""Marketplace install state — sqlite-backed canonical home (v0.5.0).

Before v0.5.0 the install state lived in
`/app/data/marketplace_installs.json`, written by the Next.js layer
(see `mcp/agent/lib/marketplace-installs.ts`). The state was disconnected
from the MCP — the agent couldn't see what was installed, the install
button didn't actually gate anything functional, and the file format
was the only source of truth that lived OUTSIDE the MCP's storage
boundary.

v0.5.0 collapses to a single canonical home in MCP — same pattern the
v0.4.0 auth redesign used for credentials + sessions. The install
state now lives in this SQLite store, behind a proper API
(`POST /api/v1/marketplace/<id>/install`, `uninstall`), and ALL
upstream callers (Next.js, the agent's chat tool surface) read/write
through that API. The JSON file gets a one-shot import on first
v0.5.0 boot and then is deleted.

# Schema

    marketplace_installs(
      connector_id  TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      installed_at  TEXT NOT NULL,        -- ISO 8601 UTC
      origin        TEXT NOT NULL,        -- 'bundle' | 'user'
      version       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'bundled'
    );

`origin` is the system/user-added distinction (one of the v0.5.0
requirements). It's set at install time:
  - 'bundle' for the 6 connectors shipped in the image
    (`bundles/spark/connectors/*`)
  - 'user' for connectors uploaded via the marketplace upload path
    (`POST /api/v1/marketplace/upload` writes the YAML to
    `/app/data/user_connectors/<id>/` and inserts a row here with
    origin='user')

`origin` gates deletion: `DELETE /api/v1/marketplace/<id>` returns 403
if origin='bundle' (cannot remove bundle connectors from the catalog
at runtime — the image holds the source). User connectors can be
deleted via the same endpoint.

# What this store does NOT hold

  - The connector catalogue itself (manifest + tool list + config
    schema). That's derived from `connector.yaml` files on disk —
    bundle ones in the image, user ones in
    `/app/data/user_connectors/`. Read at boot + on each
    `GET /api/v1/marketplace`.
  - Instance records (`instances.db` is the canonical home, see
    `instance_store.py`).
  - Per-connector state machine (`connector_state.db`, see
    `connector_state_store.py`).

This store is JUST the install-state flag + origin per connector_id.
Minimal by design.

# One-shot migration from marketplace_installs.json

On first v0.5.0 boot the store checks for the legacy JSON file at
`/app/data/marketplace_installs.json`. If present, each connector_id
inside gets a row inserted with `origin='bundle'` (the legacy file
only ever held bundle connectors — there was no upload path
pre-v0.5.0). After successful import the JSON file is deleted, leaving
the DB as the sole source of truth. This is idempotent: re-running
won't re-insert rows (PRIMARY KEY constraint).

# Concurrency

All operations take the module-level `_lock` while inside SQLite.
Multiple async tasks reading/writing the store from the same MCP
process serialize on this lock. The DB itself is opened with
`check_same_thread=False` because the FastMCP handler pool runs
multiple workers; each call opens its own short-lived connection.
