"""SecretStore — bundle-local implementation of the spec's `secrets`
capability (spec.md §6.10 row 17).

Per spec §6.10, `secrets` has two backend impls:

  - **Standalone**: `_EnvSecretStore` reads `SPARK_SECRET_<KEY>` env vars.
  - **Platform**:   `InfisicalSecretStore` reads from Infisical at the
                    declared `secretRefs` path.

This module is a third backend — file-backed, encrypted-at-rest with
AES-256-GCM, with the same `read(path) → value` interface as the
planned Infisical backend. It exists because Guardian's setup-form UX
(operator types secrets in the browser) doesn't fit the env-var
pattern (which assumes secrets pre-exist in `process.env` before
container boot). When/if Guardian adopts Infisical for standalone,
the SecretStore becomes a thin router that delegates to either the
encrypted file backend (today) or the Infisical client (later).
The `read(path)`/`write(path, value)` interface stays unchanged.

# Encryption-at-rest (Phase 13)

When `GUARDIAN_SECRET_KEK` is set in the environment, every secret
value gets encrypted before it touches disk:

    plaintext value
        → AES-256-GCM encrypt with random 96-bit nonce
        → header `v1\\x00` + nonce(12) + ciphertext + tag(16)
        → base64-encoded to disk (atomic write, mode 0600)

KEK format: 32 bytes, base64-encoded. Generate with:

    openssl rand -base64 32

The KEK lives alongside MCP_TOKEN in operator `.env` — same lifecycle,
same backup discipline. **Lose the KEK and every operator-supplied
secret becomes unrecoverable** (the operator must re-fill the setup
form). This trade-off is the security win: the secrets directory +
backup tarball are useless without the KEK.

When `GUARDIAN_SECRET_KEK` is unset, the store falls back to the
legacy plaintext mode with a loud startup warning. This preserves
upgrade compatibility for existing deploys; operators upgrade to
encryption by setting the env var and restarting (the next read of
each secret rewrites it as encrypted automatically — see migration
behavior in `read()`).

# Path conventions

Paths follow the spec's `/<scope>/<id>/<sub-id>/<slot>` form. For
Guardian-locally-materialized secrets (those collected via the setup
form), the convention is:

    /agents/guardian/connectors/<instance_id>/<slot_name>
    /agents/guardian/providers/<instance_id>/<slot_name>

These paths get persisted in `instances.db:secrets_json` /
`provider_instances.db:secrets_json` instead of the secret VALUES,
so the sqlite databases hold ONLY references — even if leaked, the
attacker has no useful credential material.

# Filesystem layout

The file backend mirrors the path structure 1:1 under
`<data_root>/secrets/`:

    /app/data/secrets/
    └── agents/
        └── guardian/
            ├── connectors/
            │   ├── 64b06eab-.../api_key       (mode 0600)
            │   └── c2caee7b-.../bot_token
            └── providers/
                └── 9d3e1f.../service_account_json

When GUARDIAN_SECRET_KEK is set, file contents are base64-encoded
ciphertext with a `v1\\x00` magic header. Without the KEK they're
UTF-8 plaintext (legacy / first-boot state).

# Audit

Every read/write/delete records to the SqliteAuditLog (Phase 6) with
target=`secret:<path>`. Paths are logged, never values. The plaintext
material exists only transiently in process memory at the moment a
tool call resolves it.

    #   - CI smoke tests (set env vars instead of driving the setup
    #     form via Playwright)

    #     install of that site picks them up automatically)
