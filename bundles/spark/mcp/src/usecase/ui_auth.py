"""UI password hashing + verification, backed by SecretStore.

What this module owns:
  - Hashing operator passwords with a slow KDF (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256,
    600k iterations — OWASP 2023 recommendation for passwords).
  - Versioned envelope `pbkdf2_sha256$<iterations>$<salt_b64>$<hash_b64>`
    so we can rotate the algorithm later without breaking existing
    hashes.
  - Constant-time comparison on verify so timing-attack-by-prefix
    isn't possible.
  - SecretStore as the on-disk format: one file per username at
    `/ui/auth/<username>/password_hash`, AES-256-GCM encrypted at
    rest when PHANTOM_SECRET_KEK is set.

What this module does NOT do:
  - Session cookies / JWTs — handled by the Next.js side (the agent's
    /api/auth/login/route.ts sets the phantom_auth cookie after a
    successful verify here).
  - Multi-user — there's a single operator account on Phantom in
    v0.1.x. The username is still stored separately so we can grow
    into multi-user without breaking the schema.

Why pbkdf2 and not bcrypt/argon2:
  - Built into Python's hashlib (no new dep on the MCP image).
  - 600k SHA-256 iterations is ~250ms on a modern CPU — slow enough
    to make brute-force impractical for any plausible password.
  - Migration path to argon2 is a one-line change in `_hash_v1` if
    we ever want to. Existing hashes stay valid because the envelope
    encodes its algorithm.
