"""InProcessApprovalsBus — bundle-local implementation of the spec's
`approvals` capability (spec.md §6.10 row "approvals").

Per spec §6.10 there are two approvals backends:

  - **Standalone**: `InProcessApprovalsBus` — a single-process queue
                    backed by a sqlite table for durability. Pending
                    approvals get an `asyncio.Event` (or
                    `threading.Event` for sync tools) keyed by id,
                    and `/api/v1/approvals/{id}/resolve` sets it.
  - **Platform**:   `KafkaApprovalsBus` — pending requests publish to
                    a Kafka topic the platform's UI consumes; resolution
                    flows back via another topic.

This module is the standalone variant. The interface is intentionally
minimal:

  request(tool, actor, args, namespaced, legacy)  → str (approval_id)
  await wait_async(approval_id, timeout=...)      → (status, reason)
  wait_sync(approval_id, timeout=...)             → (status, reason)
  resolve(approval_id, resolver, decision, reason) → bool
  list_pending()                                   → list[Approval]
  list_recent(limit)                               → list[Approval]
  get(approval_id)                                 → Approval | None

# Schema (`<data_root>/approvals.db`)

    approvals(
      id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,    -- uuid4
      created_at  TEXT NOT NULL,        -- ISO8601 UTC, microsecond
      resolved_at TEXT,                 -- nullable; set on resolve
      tool        TEXT NOT NULL,        -- bare tool name from manifest
      namespaced  TEXT NOT NULL,        -- "<connector>.<tool>"
      actor       TEXT,                 -- "agent" (the requester)
      resolver    TEXT,                 -- "user:operator" (set on resolve)
      status      TEXT NOT NULL,        -- pending|approved|denied|timeout
      args_json   TEXT NOT NULL,        -- JSON of args being approved
      reason      TEXT                  -- optional human note
    );
    CREATE INDEX idx_approvals_status   ON approvals(status);
    CREATE INDEX idx_approvals_tool     ON approvals(tool);
    CREATE INDEX idx_approvals_created  ON approvals(created_at);

# Crash semantics

The in-memory `_waiters` dict goes away on process restart. If a tool
call was blocked on `wait_async` when the MCP died, the agent's MCP
request also dies — the next invocation starts fresh. Pending rows in
the sqlite table get reaped on next boot via `_reap_orphaned_pending()`
which marks anything still pending older than the boot time as
"timeout" with status_reason="orphaned". That keeps the UI from
showing zombie approvals.

# Block-until-resolved is intentional

The agent's MCP tool call blocks until the human resolves. From the
agent's perspective this looks like a slow tool call — no special
state machine needed. The configured timeout (default 5 minutes) is
the upper bound. Phase 8 (sessions + memory) can later add a
"pending_approval" prompt the agent shows the operator, but the
mechanic itself is: wrapper waits, human clicks, wrapper proceeds.

        The framework occasionally injects framework-internal objects

        here when an approval row is recorded. Pre-v0.1.20 this raised
        `TypeError: Object of type Context is not JSON serializable`
        and the entire approval request failed — operator never saw
        the request, agent saw a 500.

        Coerce to a stable, redacted string ('<TypeName>') so:
          * the approval row always lands in the DB,
          * the audit trail isn't poisoned by an arbitrary repr() that
            might leak referenced secrets,
