"""Fire-and-forget hook callback to the agent — Issue #28 fire-sites (v0.5.32).

The hook dispatcher (lib/hook-runner.ts) lives TS-side, so MCP-side
code paths (notification publish, approval request) need a way to
trigger hook dispatch. v0.5.32 introduces an internal endpoint on
the agent — `/api/agent/internal/fire-hook` — that MCP calls when a
hook-eligible event happens.

Constraints:

  - Best-effort: a failed callback must NOT break the notification /
    approval creation that triggered it. Errors get logged and
    swallowed.
  - Non-blocking: notifications/approvals are sync code paths;
    blocking them on an HTTP round-trip would slow every event.
    Fire the callback in a background thread so the caller returns
    immediately.
  - Loopback only: the agent's internal endpoint lives at
    `GUARDIAN_AGENT_INTERNAL_URL` (default `https://guardian-agent:8080`
    inside the compose network), gated by `MCP_TOKEN` bearer.

Recursion caveat: if an operator installs a Notification hook whose
handler creates more notifications, we'll fire another callback,
which fires the hook again, etc. v0.5.32 ships without recursion
defense — documented in the CHANGELOG as a known caveat for
Notification hook authors. A cleaner defense (header-based source
tagging) lands in a follow-up release if the caveat bites operators
in practice.
