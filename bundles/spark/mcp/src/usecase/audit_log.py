"""SqliteAuditLog — bundle-local implementation of the spec's `audit`
capability (spec.md §6.10 row 14).

Per spec §6.10, `audit` has two backend impls:

  - **Standalone**: `SqliteAuditLog` writes append-only rows to a local
                    sqlite DB under `<data_root>/audit.db`.
  - **Platform**:   `OpenSearchAuditLog` writes to the platform's
                    central audit index, queryable via Kibana etc.

This module is the standalone variant. The interface is intentionally
minimal — `record(action, target, ...)` and a few `query_*()` helpers
for the /api/v1/audit endpoint. The platform variant can be a thin
adapter over the same interface.

# Append-only contract

There is intentionally NO `update` or `delete` API. SOC audit trails
must be tamper-evident; the bundle's UI exposes read-only views. Row
deletion would require operating on the sqlite file directly with
elevated privileges.

# What gets recorded

Per `manifest.yaml:audit.events`:

    tool_call                       — every connector tool invocation
    setup_completed                 — POST /api/v1/setup
    settings_changed                — POST /api/v1/settings (Phase 12)
    instance_created                — InstanceStore.create / setup_submit

Plus the secret-store + provider-store + delete events that aren't
in the manifest's audit.events list but the spec's §6.10 row 14
requires every state-changing action to leave a trace:

    secret_read     — SecretStore.read
    secret_write    — SecretStore.write
    secret_deleted  — SecretStore.delete + delete_under
    instance_deleted — InstanceStore.delete
    provider_created — ProviderStore.create
    provider_deleted — ProviderStore.delete

# Actor inference

The current contextvar (set by future auth middleware) supplies the
actor when known. For now the actor is inferred:

  - Any direct admin endpoint hit comes through `require_bearer`, so
    the actor is "user:operator" (the human who knows the MCP token).
  - Tool calls during MCP dispatch are "agent".
  - Migration / boot reads are "system".

Phase 7 (approvals) will start writing distinct actors for
human-approved actions vs autonomous ones; this module's `record(...)`
API takes `actor` as an arg so that's a no-op extension.

# Why a separate contextvar instead of overloading `_current_trigger`:
# the trigger value identifies the SOURCE of activity (chat session,

# the operator made for that source. Coupling them ("trigger=job:xyz
# implies bypass") would force every scheduler-driven job to lose
# approval, which is the opposite of what we want — bypass is opt-in,
# per chat session via the chat dropdown or per job via the job
# definition's bypass_approvals toggle. Keeping the two contextvars
# separate keeps the two decisions independent.
