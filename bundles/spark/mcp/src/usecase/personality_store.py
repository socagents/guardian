"""SqlitePersonalityStore — operator-tunable agent persona, persisted
in the MCP's data root so the embedded MCP and the agent UI share
one source of truth.

Why a dedicated store (rather than putting personality in
SettingsStore):

  - Settings are key-typed scalars constrained by
    manifest.settings.overridable[]. Personality is a richer JSON
    document with sliders, free-form markdown, and a model preference.
    Forcing it into key-value would either flatten the structure
    (losing arrays/nested) or balloon `overridable[]` with dozens of
    `personality.*` entries the manifest doesn't actually want to
    enumerate.
  - Personality has its own write semantics: read-modify-write with
    diff (the operator is shown the change before approval). Settings
    are typed individual sets/clears.
  - Migration story: pre-Phase-11 personality lived in the agent UI's
    `setup.json:values.personality` (a JSON blob). This store reads
    that blob on first init and copies it in (one-time migration), so
    operator-saved persona survives the move.

# Single-row store

Personality is global (single agent, single persona) — there's no
multi-tenancy here in standalone mode. A single row keyed by `id=1`
holds the full document; the table also keeps a small history (last
N versions) so the diff renderer in Commit 6's UI can show "what
changed" without keeping app-side state.

# Schema

    personality (
      id           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY CHECK (id = 1),  -- single-row
      blob_json    TEXT NOT NULL,                       -- the persona doc
      updated_at   TEXT NOT NULL,                       -- ISO8601 UTC
      updated_by   TEXT,                                -- actor (audit)
      version      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1           -- monotonic
    );

    personality_history (
      version      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      blob_json    TEXT NOT NULL,
      updated_at   TEXT NOT NULL,
      updated_by   TEXT
    );

# Audit

The `personality_changed` event (added to manifest.audit.events in
Commit 3a) records every put with the actor identity. Values are
non-secret (no credentials live here) so the diff is safe to log.
