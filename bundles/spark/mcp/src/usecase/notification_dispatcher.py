"""WebhookDispatcher — channel:* notification fanout to operator-supplied URLs.

Closes the "infrastructure ready, no producers wired" gap left by
commit 09e4193: SqliteNotificationStore.publish() accepted a
DispatchHook callable for channel:* targets but main.py wired it as
None. Now publish("detection-miss", ...) (target=channel:soc)
actually reaches Slack/PagerDuty/whatever the operator configured.

# Configuration

Each channel's webhook URL is read from an env var at startup.
The naming convention:

    target              env var
    channel:soc         PHANTOM_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_SOC
    channel:purple-team PHANTOM_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_PURPLE_TEAM
                        (hyphens become underscores in the var name)

Channels with no configured URL skip cleanly — the notification
still persists (dispatch_status="stored"), just without an outbound
call. Operators can fill missing URLs later without losing prior
notifications.

# Why env vars, not the SecretStore

Webhook URLs ARE credentials (Slack incoming-webhook tokens are
bearer-equivalent). Two reasons env vars are the right surface for
this iteration:

  1. Operators already manage env-style config via .env (MCP_TOKEN,
     PHANTOM_SECRET_KEK live there). Adding more env vars matches
     the existing operational model.
  2. The SecretStore is the right home for connector secrets — those
     flow through the setup form. Notification webhooks are a
     deployment-time config, not part of the connector instance
     model. Different surface, different lifecycle.

A future improvement could add a setup-form section for channel
URLs that writes them to the SecretStore at paths like
`/agents/phantom/notifications/channels/<name>/webhook_url`. Until
then, env-var config keeps the surface small and the
configurable-without-rebuild story intact.

# Payload shape

The default dispatcher sends a generic JSON payload:

    POST <webhook_url>
    Content-Type: application/json
    {
      "topic":     "detection-miss",
      "severity":  "warning",
      "target":    "channel:soc",
      "id":        "<notification uuid>",
      "created_at": "<iso8601>",
      "payload":   {...the application's own payload...}
    }

This works as-is for any webhook receiver that accepts arbitrary JSON
(generic SOAR, internal services). For Slack incoming webhooks the
operator can chain through a thin adapter (the `text`/`blocks` shape
Slack expects). Future improvement: per-channel formatter selection
based on URL host (slack.com → Slack-shaped, events.pagerduty.com →
PagerDuty Events API v2, etc.).

# Failure handling

The hook raises on dispatch failure. SqliteNotificationStore.publish()
catches that and records dispatch_status="failed" + dispatch_error.
The notification still persists — the operator sees what didn't
reach where via /api/v1/notifications, even when the upstream is
down.
