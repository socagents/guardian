"""Process-wide tool-dispatcher singleton.

A small accessor pair (set/get) for the dispatcher the job scheduler
already constructs at boot. Exposed here so other code paths
(specifically v0.3.11+ `agent_batch_propose` for connector-tool
batching) can dispatch to any registered tool by name without
duplicating the fastmcp.Client wiring.

Same singleton pattern as `set_scheduler` / `get_scheduler` in
job_scheduler — module-level holder, main.py installs it at boot,
consumers `get_tool_dispatcher()` and either dispatch or return a
clean error if the runtime isn't fully wired.

# Why a singleton rather than passing the dispatcher around

Two consumers (the scheduler + agent_batch_propose) need it at runtime,
and threading the dispatcher through the entire MCP-tool callsite would
mean re-wiring every existing self_mod_tool. The singleton keeps the
new dispatcher coupling local to v0.3.11's expansion.

# Lifecycle

main.py async_main() constructs the dispatcher AFTER register_all_tools
populates the tool_registry. Tools registered via setup-form reload
(api/setup.py) re-use the same registry dict (mutated in place), so the
dispatcher closure stays current without a re-set.
