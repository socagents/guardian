"""Connector state machine — Round-15 / Phase M.

Tracks the lifecycle of every configured tool connector so operators
can see at a glance which integrations are healthy vs. need
attention. Replaces the implicit "tool errored => maybe auth issue"
guesswork with explicit per-connector state.

Adapted from SnowAgent's MCP connection states
(snow-agent-complete/snow-agent/07-mcp/services/mcp/) — same five
states (`connected | failed | needs-auth | pending | disabled`).

# State semantics

  - `connected` — the connector responded successfully to its last
    health probe / tool call. Operator: green dot, no action needed.
  - `pending` — never been probed, or being initialized after a
    config change. Operator: amber dot, give it a moment.
  - `failed` — last call returned a non-auth error (e.g. XSIAM
    5xx, upstream unreachable). Operator: red dot, check the
    upstream service.
  - `needs-auth` — last call returned 401/403. Operator: orange
    dot, click "Reauth" to re-run the OAuth / token-refresh flow.
  - `disabled` — operator explicitly turned the connector off via
    the /connectors UI. Operator: grey dot, won't be probed.

# Transitions

      pending  → connected   (first successful call)
              → failed       (transport error)
              → needs-auth   (401/403)
              → disabled     (operator action)

      connected → failed     (transport error)
                → needs-auth (401/403)
                → disabled

      failed    → connected  (recovery)
                → needs-auth
                → disabled

      needs-auth → connected (reauth + first success)
                 → disabled

      disabled  → pending    (operator re-enables)

The state is NOT terminal in any case; transitions cycle as the
connector's external service comes and goes.

# Why a separate store (vs. tagging instances or extending
# instance_store)

Instances carry CONFIGURATION (URLs, references to secrets).
Connector state tracks RUNTIME health which changes minute-to-
minute. Mixing them would mean every health update writes to
the instance row, churning that DB. A dedicated state table
keeps the configuration writes append-rare and the health
writes append-frequent without crossing.
