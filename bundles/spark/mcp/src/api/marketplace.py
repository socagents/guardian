"""Marketplace API — v0.5.0 canonical install-state surface.

Replaces the pre-v0.5.0 Next.js-owned `marketplace_installs.json` file
with a proper MCP-side REST surface backed by `marketplace_store.py`.
The Next.js routes under `app/api/agent/marketplace/*` become thin
proxies to this layer (same pattern as v0.4.0 auth: agent UI calls
Next.js → Next.js proxies to MCP → MCP owns the canonical state).

Endpoints (all require `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_TOKEN>`):

  GET    /api/v1/marketplace                       → catalog + install state
  GET    /api/v1/marketplace/{connector_id}        → single connector detail
  POST   /api/v1/marketplace/{connector_id}/install   → mark installed
  POST   /api/v1/marketplace/{connector_id}/uninstall → unmark (409 if instances)
  DELETE /api/v1/marketplace/{connector_id}        → delete user connector entirely
                                                     (403 for bundle connectors;
                                                      Phase E wires this)

Catalog source (read at every list call — cheap; just YAML on disk):

  Bundle connectors: manifest.yaml:toolConnectors[] + each entry's
    connector.yaml (image-baked under bundles/spark/connectors/<id>/)
  User connectors:   /app/data/user_connectors/<id>/connector.yaml
    (Phase E wires this directory; Phase A scans an empty dir if
     missing, so the route is forward-compatible)

Install/uninstall mutations DO NOT modify the catalog — they ONLY
flip the install marker in marketplace.db. Per Decision 2 of the
v0.5.0 spec, removing the install marker does NOT remove the
connector from the marketplace — it just makes it "available, not
installed". Bundle connectors STAY listed forever (image-baked);
user connectors stay until explicitly DELETEd.

Authority boundary:

  * Install state mutation: anyone holding MCP_TOKEN (Next.js layer
    + the agent's own chat handler via the future
    `marketplace_install` MCP tool). Per the v0.4.0 credential
    guardrail, install state is CATALOG metadata, not a credential
    — agent tools CAN read/write it. CLAUDE.md will be amended to
    spell out the "catalog boundary ≠ credential boundary"
    distinction in Phase F.
  * Instance state: same audit-event attribution policy as
    api/instances.py — `user:operator` for human-driven mutations,
    `agent` when the chat agent invokes the analogous tool.
