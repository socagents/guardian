"""Audit query HTTP endpoints — Phase 6 of the v1.2 architecture.

The Next.js agent's admin/security view calls these to render the
audit feed (recent events, action breakdown, search). External SOC
tools can also poll them for SIEM ingestion.

Endpoints (all require `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_TOKEN>`):

  GET /api/v1/audit               → paginated events (filterable)
  GET /api/v1/audit/summary       → counts-by-action posture rollup
  GET /api/v1/audit/stream        → SSE feed of new audit events
                                    (replaces the deprecated A2UI
                                    surfaceUpdate fan-out into the
                                    Activity surface — see the v1.2
                                    A2UI removal in commit 4e51b29).

Read-only by design — the audit log is append-only at the storage
layer (no DELETE/UPDATE in SqliteAuditLog). Even with admin token, an
operator can't tamper with the log via HTTP. The only way to clear
audit history is to delete `<data_root>/audit.db` from the host (with
the corresponding ops/forensic implications).

Query params for GET /api/v1/audit:
    action          one of the manifest's audit.events (or the
                    instance/secret/provider events recorded by the
                    SqliteAuditLog itself)
    actor           "agent" | "user:operator" | "system"
    target          exact match, e.g. "tool:xsiam.run_xql_query"
    target_prefix   LIKE prefix, e.g. "tool:" or "instance:"

        On connect, replays the most recent N events as a baseline so

        events with id > the last seen id, and emits any new rows as
        SSE frames. Heartbeat every 25s to keep proxies happy.

        Why polling vs. an in-process pub/sub: the producer side hooks
        (the surface_bus.publish() calls deleted in 4e51b29) added
        complexity for a feed that doesn't need sub-second latency.
        SQLite is plenty fast at SELECT WHERE id > ? LIMIT 50 — the
        whole audit table is in-memory after the first read, and 1s
        polling plus an event volume of <100/min means each tick
        either finds nothing (fast no-op) or finds 1-2 rows.

        Disconnect / reconnect is the client's responsibility (the
        agent's /activity page handles it with exponential backoff).
        Rows are emitted in chronological order (oldest first within

        for compaction lifecycle, context-window warnings, and Vertex
        cache hits — none of which are tool calls (so no `tool_call`
        audit row is auto-written) and none of which mutate MCP state
        directly (so no other audit hook fires either). Without this
        endpoint those events stay live-only — they don't show up in
        /observability/events on subsequent loads. After this, the
        operator can run `action:chat_compaction_end` (etc.) queries
        against the audit DB and see the historical pattern.

        Body shape:
          {
            "action":      "chat_compaction_end" | ... ,   # required

        The actor is fixed to "user:operator" because the bearer

        inherited from the X-Guardian-Trigger header (handled by the
        trigger_context middleware via the contextvar).
