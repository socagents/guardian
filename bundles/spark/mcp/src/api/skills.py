"""Skills HTTP endpoints — operator-direct REST surface for the
Next.js agent's `/skills` page.

The agent's `/skills` page calls these to render the skills catalog,
read MD content, edit it, create new skills, and delete stale ones.
Operators clicking buttons in the UI ARE the approver — they don't
need the Phase-11 chat-agent approval gate that exists to catch
self-modification attempts by the agent.

Endpoints (all require `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_TOKEN>`):

  GET    /api/v1/skills                          → list all skills
  GET    /api/v1/skills/{file_path:path}         → read one skill
  POST   /api/v1/skills                          → create new skill
                                                   (body: category,
                                                   filename, content)
  PUT    /api/v1/skills/{file_path:path}         → update content
                                                   (body: content)
  PATCH  /api/v1/skills/{file_path:path}         → toggle enabled flag
                                                   (body: {enabled: bool})
  DELETE /api/v1/skills/{file_path:path}         → soft-delete one
                                                   (file moves to
                                                   /app/skills/.deleted/)

Why this module exists (Phase 11 architectural addendum)

The MCP exposes two surfaces for skills mutation:

  1. Tool path — `tools/call name=skills_delete`. Goes through the
     Phase-11 gated wrapper at
     `usecase/builtin_components/self_mod_tools.skills_delete` →
     `gate_and_execute()` blocks waiting for operator approval. The
     wrapper exists because the agent (chat-driven) might decide to
     delete a skill mid-conversation; operators want a chance to
     intervene before that happens.
  2. REST path — these endpoints. Bypass the gate by calling
     `skills_crud.skills_delete` (and friends) directly. The Next.js
     agent's `/api/skills` route proxies operator-direct UI clicks to
     this REST surface, so clicking the trash icon in `/skills` does
     NOT require a separate approval-queue acknowledgement (the click
     IS the approval).

The same dual-surface pattern already exists for jobs, instances,
providers, settings, personality, etc. — see `api/jobs.py`,
`api/instances.py`, etc. Skills are the last destructive resource
that didn't have its REST counterpart; this module closes that gap.

Earlier attempt (v0.3.4 commit b6900e8) tried to bypass the gate by
sending `X-Guardian-Approval-Bypass: 1` from the Next.js side, relying
on the trigger_context middleware to set a contextvar that
`gate_and_execute` reads. Empirically that contextvar does NOT
propagate from the Starlette middleware into FastMCP's streamable-HTTP
tool dispatcher (suspected cause: FastMCP spawns the tool execution in
a child asyncio task whose context was captured before the middleware
ran). The REST-endpoint approach in this module sidesteps the
contextvar propagation question entirely by avoiding the gate
altogether — same way the other resources do.
