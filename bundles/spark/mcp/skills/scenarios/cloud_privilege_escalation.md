# Skill: Cloud privilege escalation chain

## Category

scenarios

## Attack Type

Pure cloud-IAM attack post-foothold. Models what happens AFTER the attacker has gotten cloud-platform access (via OAuth abuse from `oauth_consent_to_cloud_pivot`, or via leaked credentials, or via a CI/CD pipeline compromise). They establish persistence by creating their own service account with their own key, escalate that SA to Owner, and start exfiltrating data using the new identity from a region they control.

This skill is intentionally cloud-only — no proxy / firewall / EDR data classes — to validate that cloud audit telemetry alone catches the chain.

## MITRE ATT&CK Tactics

- TA0001: Initial Access (T1078.004 Cloud Accounts)
- TA0003: Persistence (T1098.001 Additional Cloud Credentials, T1136.003 Create Cloud Account)
- TA0004: Privilege Escalation (T1098.003 Additional Cloud Roles)
- TA0009: Collection (T1530 Data from Cloud Storage Object)

## XSIAM analytics rules triggered

| # | Rule | Stage |
|---|---|---|
| 17 | Cloud IAM Key Creation (suspicious identity) | Stage 1 |
| 18 | Cloud Privilege Escalation Role Binding | Stage 2 |
| 4 | Anomalous Cloud Region Access (variant: cross-region access from new SA) | Stage 3 |

## Data classes used

| Stage | Data class | If missing |
|---|---|---|
| 1, 2, 3 | `cloud` | Required — entire skill is cloud-audit-telemetry-only |

## Pre-flight

Call `phantom_get_technology_stack`. Verify `cloud` is present. If missing, this skill cannot run; chain it with `oauth_consent_to_cloud_pivot` instead which models the SaaS → cloud pivot earlier in the kill chain.

## Narrative thread

- **Compromised cloud user:** `cicd-deployer@bupa.example` (CI/CD service-account-like user with platform admin)
- **Source IP for the malicious activity:** `194.165.16.45` (anomalous — the CI/CD pipeline normally runs from `10.10.0.0/8` internal egress)
- **Source country:** `RU`
- **Cloud project:** `gcp-prod-bupa`
- **New SA created:** `data-export-svc@gcp-prod-bupa.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **New SA key ID:** `8f3a91d2c4b7e5a8d6f9b2c1e4a7d3f5b8c2e9a1`
- **Targeted bucket:** `gs://bupa-prod-claims-data` (multi-TB customer claims data)
- **Baseline access region (legitimate CI/CD):** `us-west1`
- **Anomalous access region (post-escalation):** `us-east4` (then `europe-west1`)
- **Wall-clock time:** Stage 1 ~3 min (SA + key creation). Stage 2 ~5 min (role escalation). Stage 3 ~15 min (data access).

### Stage 1 — SA + key creation — 4 events over 2 minutes

The attacker creates a new service account in the project. Within seconds they create a USER_MANAGED key for it (a JSON key file they can download and use externally). The actor is the legitimate `cicd-deployer` user, but the IP is anomalous.

**Data class:** `cloud`

```yaml
xlog.create_data_worker:
  request:
    type:    <stack[cloud].formats[0].upper()>
    vendor:  <stack[cloud].vendor>
    product: <stack[cloud].product>
    count:    4
    interval: 30
    destination: <stack.log_destination.type>
    duration_seconds: 120
    observables_dict:
      project_id:    ["gcp-prod-bupa"]
      actor_email:   ["cicd-deployer@bupa.example"]
      actor_ip:      ["194.165.16.45"]
      country:       ["RU"]
      action:        ["google.iam.admin.v1.CreateServiceAccount",
                      "google.iam.admin.v1.CreateServiceAccountKey"]
      api_endpoint:  ["iam.googleapis.com"]
      api_method:    ["projects.serviceAccounts.create",
                      "projects.serviceAccounts.keys.create"]
      resource_name: ["projects/gcp-prod-bupa/serviceAccounts/data-export-svc@gcp-prod-bupa.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
                      "projects/gcp-prod-bupa/serviceAccounts/data-export-svc@gcp-prod-bupa.iam.gserviceaccount.com/keys/8f3a91d2c4b7e5a8d6f9b2c1e4a7d3f5b8c2e9a1"]
      sa_email:      ["data-export-svc@gcp-prod-bupa.iam.gserviceaccount.com"]
      sa_key_id:     ["8f3a91d2c4b7e5a8d6f9b2c1e4a7d3f5b8c2e9a1"]
      sa_key_type:   ["USER_MANAGED"]
      sa_description: ["Data export service for nightly batch jobs"]
      authentication_method: ["oauth_token"]
      authentication_protocol: ["GoogleIDP"]
      severity:      ["high", "critical"]
      caller_user_agent: ["google-cloud-sdk/470.0.0"]
      access_level:  ["roles/owner (inherited)"]
      operation_status: ["SUCCESS"]
```

**Field semantics:**
- `actor_email: cicd-deployer@bupa.example` — legitimate user; the anomaly is `actor_ip` and `country`
- `sa_email: data-export-svc@...` — innocuous-sounding name. Attackers typically pick names that blend in with existing infrastructure; "data-export-svc" sounds like a normal data-pipeline component
- `sa_description` — even more so; attackers fill in description fields to make the SA look legit
- `sa_key_type: USER_MANAGED` — the riskiest key type. Cloud-managed keys auto-rotate; user-managed are long-lived
- `caller_user_agent: google-cloud-sdk/470.0.0` — attacker is using gcloud CLI (vs the web console), suggesting scripted automation
- `access_level: roles/owner (inherited)` — the actor (cicd-deployer) has Owner; this is what gives them permission to create a new SA at all

**Why this fires Rule #17:** the IAM-key-creation event from anomalous `actor_ip` is high-fidelity in any modern cloud-detection ruleset. Even ignoring IP, USER_MANAGED key creation in a production project is rare and worth alerting on.

---

### Stage 2 — Role-binding privilege escalation — 3 events over 2 minutes

The attacker now grants the new SA broad permissions: `roles/owner` on the project, plus `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` so the SA can impersonate other SAs (broadening attack surface).

**Data class:** `cloud`

```yaml
xlog.create_data_worker:
  request:
    type:    <stack[cloud].formats[0].upper()>
    vendor:  <stack[cloud].vendor>
    product: <stack[cloud].product>
    count:    3
    interval: 40
    destination: <stack.log_destination.type>
    duration_seconds: 120
    observables_dict:
      project_id:    ["gcp-prod-bupa"]
      actor_email:   ["cicd-deployer@bupa.example"]
      actor_ip:      ["194.165.16.45"]
      country:       ["RU"]
      action:        ["google.cloud.resourcemanager.v1.SetIamPolicy",
                      "google.iam.admin.v1.SetIamPolicy"]
      api_endpoint:  ["cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com",
                      "iam.googleapis.com"]
      api_method:    ["projects.setIamPolicy",
                      "projects.serviceAccounts.setIamPolicy"]
      resource_name: ["projects/gcp-prod-bupa",
                      "projects/gcp-prod-bupa/serviceAccounts/data-export-svc@gcp-prod-bupa.iam.gserviceaccount.com"]
      target_member: ["serviceAccount:data-export-svc@gcp-prod-bupa.iam.gserviceaccount.com"]
      role_granted:  ["roles/owner",
                      "roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator",
                      "roles/iam.serviceAccountUser"]
      role_removed:  []
      authentication_method: ["oauth_token"]
      severity:      ["critical"]
      operation_status: ["SUCCESS"]
      policy_change_diff: ["+roles/owner", "+roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"]
      caller_user_agent: ["google-cloud-sdk/470.0.0"]
```

**Field semantics:**
- `target_member` — the new SA being elevated
- `role_granted: roles/owner` — full project ownership; equivalent to giving the SA root in the cloud world
- `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` — additional escalation: lets the SA mint tokens for OTHER SAs in the project, which the attacker can then use to access resources scoped to those other SAs (escape from any per-SA permissions boundary)
- `policy_change_diff` — the IAM-policy delta; modern cloud-detection rules can show "what changed" precisely

**Why this fires Rule #18:** granting `roles/owner` to a service account (any service account) is universally a high-severity alert. Granting it from an anomalous source IP, on a SA that was just created in the same window, is unmistakable.

---

### Stage 3 — Data access from new region using the new SA's key — ~30 events over 15 minutes

The attacker, now possessing a USER_MANAGED key for `data-export-svc` with `roles/owner`, exits the compromised user's session entirely. They authenticate to the cloud API with the SA key from their attacker infrastructure (in `us-east4`) and start downloading data from the production claims bucket. Each `storage.objects.get` call is a separate audit event.

**Data class:** `cloud`

```yaml
xlog.create_data_worker:
  request:
    type:    <stack[cloud].formats[0].upper()>
    vendor:  <stack[cloud].vendor>
    product: <stack[cloud].product>
    count:    30
    interval: 30
    destination: <stack.log_destination.type>
    duration_seconds: 900
    observables_dict:
      project_id:    ["gcp-prod-bupa"]
      actor_email:   ["data-export-svc@gcp-prod-bupa.iam.gserviceaccount.com"]
      actor_ip:      ["35.230.x.x", "104.196.x.x"]
      country:       ["US"]
      region:        ["us-east4", "europe-west1"]
      action:        ["storage.objects.get", "storage.objects.list",
                      "storage.buckets.get"]
      api_endpoint:  ["storage.googleapis.com"]
      api_method:    ["objects.get", "objects.list"]
      resource_name: ["projects/_/buckets/bupa-prod-claims-data/objects/2024/Q1/claims-batch-001.parquet",
                      "projects/_/buckets/bupa-prod-claims-data/objects/2024/Q2/claims-batch-002.parquet",
                      "projects/_/buckets/bupa-prod-claims-data/objects/2024/Q3/claims-batch-003.parquet"]
      bucket_name:   ["bupa-prod-claims-data"]
      object_size:   ["524288000", "1073741824", "2147483648"]
      authentication_method: ["service_account_key"]
      authentication_protocol: ["GoogleIDP"]
      sa_key_id:     ["8f3a91d2c4b7e5a8d6f9b2c1e4a7d3f5b8c2e9a1"]
      severity:      ["high"]
      caller_user_agent: ["python-requests/2.31.0"]
      operation_status: ["SUCCESS"]
      bytes_returned: ["524288000", "1073741824", "2147483648"]
```

**Field semantics:**
- `actor_email: data-export-svc@...` — NOT the original user. The actor is now the new SA (it authenticated with its key). This is exactly the persistence the attacker established
- `actor_ip: 35.230.x.x / 104.196.x.x` — public-internet GCP infrastructure IPs (us-east4); the attacker is calling the API from outside the bupa internal network entirely
- `region: us-east4 / europe-west1` — the SA was created in us-west1 normally; access from a NEW region for THIS SA is the anomaly signal
- `authentication_method: service_account_key` — explicit signal that the SA is being used with its USER_MANAGED key (vs OAuth token from another impersonator)
- `object_size: 500 MB - 2 GB per file` — production data files are large
- `caller_user_agent: python-requests/2.31.0` — a Python library, NOT gcloud CLI. Different tooling than Stage 1 — characteristic of the attacker now operating from their own infrastructure

**Why this fires Rule #4 (variant — cloud region anomaly):** the same SA accessing its expected resources but from a region it has no history in fires the cloud-equivalent of impossible-travel detection. Combined with the SA being newly-created (Stage 1) and recently-elevated (Stage 2), the SIEM scores this as a critical incident.

## Verification

| Indicator | Where to check |
|---|---|
| IAM SA key creation alert from `actor_ip=194.165.16.45` | XSIAM Issues |
| IAM role-binding-grants-owner alert | XSIAM Issues |
| Cloud cross-region anomalous access by `data-export-svc@...` | XSIAM Issues |
| Pivotable: filter by `project=gcp-prod-bupa` + actor IN (`cicd-deployer`, `data-export-svc`), see all 3 stages | XQL: `dataset = google_cloud_audit_logs \| filter resource.labels.project_id = "gcp-prod-bupa"` |

## Tear-down

```yaml
xlog.list_workers:
xlog.kill_worker:
  worker_id: <each>
```

## Adapting per deployment

The cloud-provider-specific action names (`google.iam.admin.v1.CreateServiceAccount`) only match GCP. For AWS, equivalents are `iam.amazonaws.com:CreateUser` + `iam.amazonaws.com:CreateAccessKey` + `sts.amazonaws.com:AssumeRole`. For Azure, `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`. The skill should be retargeted to whichever cloud the operator's stack `cloud` entry references — the chain shape (create identity → escalate → use → access from new location) is universal across providers.
