# Skill: Brute force → VPN compromise → Lateral movement

## Category

scenarios

## Attack Type

External credential attack progressing through perimeter authentication into east-west movement. Models the most common "ransomware operator's first hour": spray a set of likely usernames against the public VPN portal, pivot to focused brute force when one account responds, ride the successful authentication into an anomalous-geo session, and use the foothold for SMB/RPC reconnaissance against internal hosts.

## MITRE ATT&CK Tactics

- TA0001: Initial Access (T1078 Valid Accounts, T1133 External Remote Services)
- TA0006: Credential Access (T1110.001 Password Guessing, T1110.003 Password Spraying)
- TA0008: Lateral Movement (T1021.002 SMB/Windows Admin Shares, T1021.001 Remote Desktop Protocol)

## XSIAM analytics rules triggered

| # | Rule | Stage that fires it |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Account Probing — single source attempting many distinct accounts | Stage 1 |
| 2 | Brute Force on a Local Account — many failed logons against one user | Stage 2 |
| 3 | Password Spray — many sources, many users, low per-user rate | Stage 1 |
| 4 | Impossible Travel / Anomalous Geo Sign-in | Stage 3 |
| 12 | Anomalous Lateral Movement (SMB/RPC) | Stage 4 |

## Data classes used (resolved from the operator's technology stack at runtime)

| Stage | Data class | Why this class | If missing from stack |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `firewall` | External denied-flow signal at the perimeter | Skip Stage 1's perimeter view; rely on VPN-side fail events instead |
| 1, 2, 3 | `vpn` | Authentication outcomes (success/failure) per user | Required — skill cannot meaningfully run without VPN auth telemetry |
| 4 | `ndr` | East-west traffic anomalies after foothold | Substitute with `firewall` internal-zone deny/allow events, OR skip Stage 4 |

## Pre-flight — read the operator's stack

Before generating any data, call `phantom_get_technology_stack` once. Build a category → entry lookup. The recipes below reference the entry as `<stack[<class>].vendor>` / `<stack[<class>].product>` / `<stack[<class>].formats[0]>` — substitute the real values from the operator's stack at execution time. **Never hardcode vendor names in your tool calls** — the same skill must work whether the operator is running PANOS firewall + F5 APM VPN + Vectra NDR, or any other combination.

If a required class is missing from the stack, follow the "If missing from stack" column above before invoking the recipe for that stage.

The default `destination` for every stage is `<stack.log_destination.type>` (typically `XSIAM_WEBHOOK`) unless the operator overrides at runtime.

---

## Narrative thread (use these IDs consistently across all four stages)

So an analyst pivoting in the SIEM can follow the chain:

- **Attacker source IPs (Stage 1 spray):** 12 IPs across the public ranges `45.142.122.0/24`, `185.220.101.0/24`, `194.165.16.0/24` — distributed source pattern that defeats single-IP rate limits
- **Attacker source IP (Stage 2 focused):** `185.220.101.42` — Tor exit, threat-intel known-bad
- **Successful-auth source IP (Stage 3):** `185.220.101.42` (same as Stage 2)
- **Successful-auth source country (Stage 3):** `RU` — anomalous vs the user's normal `GB` baseline
- **Compromised user account:** `j.smith@bupa.example` — the one account whose password got guessed in Stage 2
- **VPN portal target (Stages 1-3):** internal IP `10.10.0.50`, hostname `vpn-portal-01`
- **Internal pivot host (Stage 4):** the workstation `j.smith` would normally connect to: `10.10.20.42` / `wks-jsmith-01`
- **Lateral-target hosts (Stage 4):** `10.10.10.10` (DC), `10.10.50.20` (file server), `10.10.50.21` (backup server)
- **Wall-clock time:** Stage 1 spans ~35 min (slow spray), Stage 2 ~3 min (fast burst), Stage 3 single event, Stage 4 ~12 min of east-west traffic

---

### Stage 1 — Password spray (many sources, many users) — ~500 events over 35 minutes

The attacker distributes ~500 low-rate authentication attempts across 12 source IPs against ~80 likely usernames. Per-IP rate is below typical "X failed logons in Y seconds" thresholds; per-user rate is below local-account brute-force thresholds. The pattern is only visible when the SIEM aggregates across (many sources, many users) in a window.

**Sub-stage 1A — perimeter denials (firewall sees the spray as repeated fresh TCP flows to the VPN port)**

**Data class:** `firewall`
**Format:** `<stack[firewall].formats[0]>` (typically `CEF` or `SYSLOG`)
**MITRE technique:** T1110.003 Password Spraying

```yaml
xlog.create_data_worker:
  request:
    type:    <stack[firewall].formats[0].upper()>
    vendor:  <stack[firewall].vendor>
    product: <stack[firewall].product>
    count:    300
    interval: 7
    destination: <stack.log_destination.type>
    duration_seconds: 2100
    observables_dict:
      src_ip: ["45.142.122.18", "45.142.122.91", "45.142.122.114",
               "185.220.101.42", "185.220.101.74", "185.220.101.119",
               "194.165.16.12", "194.165.16.45", "194.165.16.88",
               "194.165.16.201", "194.165.16.244", "45.142.122.252"]
      dst_ip:        ["10.10.0.50"]
      dst_port:      ["443"]
      src_port:      ["49152", "51234", "57890", "60123", "62456"]
      protocol:      ["tcp"]
      action:        ["allow"]
      app:           ["ssl"]
      bytes_sent:    ["480", "560", "320", "640", "412"]
      bytes_received: ["1240", "980", "1520"]
      session_state: ["established"]
      country:       ["RU", "BG", "RO", "MD"]
```

**Field semantics:**
- `src_ip` — distributed attacker pool; intentionally 12 IPs across 3 known-Tor / known-bad-hosting netblocks
- `dst_ip` — operator's VPN portal external interface (use the VPN entry's documented portal IP from `<stack[vpn].description>` if present, else the example `10.10.0.50`)
- `dst_port` — `443` because most VPN portals use HTTPS for client login
- `action: allow` — the firewall ALLOWS these (the rule lets `0.0.0.0/0 → vpn-portal-01:443` through; the actual auth result happens at the VPN itself in sub-stage 1B)
- `app` — application-id as the firewall classifies it; `ssl` because the auth payload is inside the TLS tunnel, opaque to the firewall
- `country` — geo enrichment if the firewall does it; spread across 4 high-risk countries to reinforce the distributed-source signal

**Why this fires the analytics:** the firewall log alone doesn't fire a rule (it's just normal-looking allowed traffic), but it provides the **external reconnaissance evidence** an analyst pivots to once Stage 2 fires. This is the breadcrumb that proves "this wasn't a single-IP attack."

**Sub-stage 1B — VPN auth failures (the spray itself, as the VPN sees it)**

      severity:              ["medium"]
      country:               ["RU", "BG", "RO", "MD"]
```

**Field semantics:**
- `user` — 80 distinct candidate usernames spanning admin defaults, common firstname.lastname patterns, service accounts, and culturally-localised first names (so the spray works against orgs of different demographics)
- `action`, `authentication_result` — the VPN's two parallel ways of expressing the same fact; populate both so the SIEM's rule matches whichever field its parser uses
- `authentication_method: password` — distinguishes from MFA / cert / SAML; password-only attempts are the ones brute-force rules key on
- `error_code` — vendor-neutral failure reasons; the SIEM's parser typically normalises these to a `failure_reason` ECS field
- `session_id` — empty `[]` because no session is established on a failed auth
- `country` — geo enrichment if the VPN does it (some products do, some don't — including it doesn't hurt)
- `vpn_gateway` — the portal hostname; lets analysts filter by which appliance saw the attempts

**Why this fires the analytics:**
- **Rule #3 (Password Spray):** the SIEM detects ≥10 distinct users attempted from a pool of distinct sources within the window, with low per-user rate. The 80 users × 12 sources × 35-min window pattern fires this cleanly. Threshold typically: ≥10 users, ≤5 attempts per user, ≥5 distinct sources.
- **Rule #1 (Account Probing):** the spray's distribution by user-count from any single source IP also crosses the account-probing threshold (typically ≥10 distinct users from one source in 5 min). A small subset of the source IPs (those given more usernames in the rotation above) hit this threshold individually.

---

### Stage 2 — Focused brute force on the one responsive account — ~50 events over 3 minutes

After the spray, the attacker has identified that `j.smith` is a real account (it returned a different error code or response time). They now focus all their energy from one source against that one user, hammering passwords from a leaked-credential list.

**Data class:** `vpn`
**Format:** `<stack[vpn].formats[0]>`
**MITRE technique:** T1110.001 Password Guessing

```yaml
xlog.create_data_worker:
  request:
    type:    <stack[vpn].formats[0].upper()>
    vendor:  <stack[vpn].vendor>
    product: <stack[vpn].product>
    count:    50
    interval: 4
    destination: <stack.log_destination.type>
    duration_seconds: 200
    observables_dict:
      src_ip:                ["185.220.101.42"]
      user:                  ["j.smith"]
      action:                ["login_failure"]
      authentication_result: ["failed"]
      authentication_method: ["password"]
      error_code:            ["INVALID_CREDENTIALS"]
      vpn_gateway:           ["vpn-portal-01"]
      severity:              ["high"]
      country:               ["RU"]
```

**Field semantics:**
- `src_ip` — single source now (one of the spray IPs from Stage 1)
- `user` — single account being hammered
- `severity: high` — many vendors auto-escalate severity once they see >N failures for one user; populate it to reflect the realistic SIEM ingestion shape
- `interval: 4` — 4 seconds between attempts means ~50 attempts in 3 minutes; well above any "brute force on local account" threshold (typically 10 attempts in 60s)

**Why this fires the analytics:**
- **Rule #2 (Brute Force on Local Account):** classic 1-source-1-user-many-fails pattern. SIEM thresholds are usually ≥10 failed attempts against the same user from the same source in ≤60 seconds.
- **Rule #1 (Account Probing) — reinforces:** the same source IP that participated in Stage 1's spray now shows up with concentrated activity, strengthening the account-probing finding.

---

### Stage 3 — Successful auth from anomalous geo — 1 event

After ~50 fails, the attacker hits the right password. One successful auth from the same source IP, same user, but the user's normal sign-in baseline is `GB`. This single event is the "the brute force succeeded" signal.

**Data class:** `vpn`
**Format:** `<stack[vpn].formats[0]>`
**MITRE technique:** T1078 Valid Accounts

```yaml
xlog.create_data_worker:
  request:
    type:    <stack[vpn].formats[0].upper()>
    vendor:  <stack[vpn].vendor>
    product: <stack[vpn].product>
    count:    1
    interval: 1
    destination: <stack.log_destination.type>
    duration_seconds: 1
    observables_dict:
      src_ip:                ["185.220.101.42"]
      user:                  ["j.smith"]
      action:                ["login_success"]
      authentication_result: ["success"]
      authentication_method: ["password"]
      session_id:            ["VPN-SESS-7f3a9c2b"]
      assigned_ip:           ["10.10.20.42"]
      vpn_gateway:           ["vpn-portal-01"]
      severity:              ["informational"]
      country:               ["RU"]
```

**Field semantics:**
- `action: login_success` + `authentication_result: success` — the auth went through
- `session_id` — populated now (the VPN issues a session token); the same value should appear in any post-auth event for this session
- `assigned_ip` — the internal IP the VPN assigns to this session (typically from a dedicated VPN client subnet — `10.10.20.0/24` here). This is critical for Stage 4: the SIEM correlates "what does this user's VPN session do once it's inside?"
- `country: RU` vs the user's normal `GB` baseline — the impossible-travel detection fires on the geographic delta within the user's session history

**Why this fires the analytics:**
- **Rule #4 (Impossible Travel / Anomalous Geo Sign-in):** the user's last successful sign-in was from `GB` within hours; this one is `RU`. Geographic distance / time-since-last-login produces an impossible-travel signal regardless of the SIEM's specific algorithm.

**Note on baseline establishment:** for the impossible-travel rule to fire, the SIEM needs at least one prior `country: GB` successful sign-in for `j.smith` in its baseline. If the operator is testing on a fresh tenant, you should pre-seed the baseline by running a small recipe of "normal sign-ins from GB" first:

```yaml
xlog.create_data_worker:
  request:
    type:    <stack[vpn].formats[0].upper()>
    vendor:  <stack[vpn].vendor>
    product: <stack[vpn].product>
    count:    8
    interval: 3600
    destination: <stack.log_destination.type>
    duration_seconds: 28800
    observables_dict:
      src_ip:    ["86.150.42.18", "86.150.42.91"]   # plausible GB residential IPs
      user:      ["j.smith"]
      action:    ["login_success"]
      country:   ["GB"]
      authentication_result: ["success"]
      authentication_method: ["password", "mfa"]
      severity:  ["informational"]
```

Skip the baseline pre-seed if the SIEM tenant has been operational for >2 weeks — real activity is plenty.

---

### Stage 4 — Anomalous east-west lateral movement — ~100 events over 12 minutes

The attacker is now inside (VPN session active, internal IP `10.10.20.42`). Within minutes they pivot to internal hosts using SMB and RPC — the workstation makes connections it has never made before in its history. NDR detects the deviation from learned baseline.

**Data class:** `ndr`
**Format:** `<stack[ndr].formats[0]>`
**MITRE techniques:** T1021.002 SMB/Windows Admin Shares, T1021.001 RDP

```yaml
xlog.create_data_worker:
  request:
    type:    <stack[ndr].formats[0].upper()>
    vendor:  <stack[ndr].vendor>
    product: <stack[ndr].product>
    count:    100
    interval: 7
    destination: <stack.log_destination.type>
    duration_seconds: 720
    observables_dict:
      src_ip:        ["10.10.20.42"]
      src_host:      ["wks-jsmith-01"]
      dst_ip:        ["10.10.10.10", "10.10.50.20", "10.10.50.21"]
      dst_host:      ["dc01", "fs01", "backup01"]
      dst_port:      ["445", "139", "3389", "5985"]

      action:        ["alert", "monitor"]
      anomaly_type:  ["lateral_movement", "unusual_internal_connection",
                      "smb_admin_share_access", "rdp_to_uncommon_destination"]
      anomaly_score: ["72", "85", "91", "68", "77"]
      alert_name:    ["Unusual SMB to admin$ share",
                      "First-time RDP from workstation to server",
                      "Lateral RPC pattern matching admin tooling"]
      alert_type:    ["ndr_lateral_movement", "ndr_anomaly"]
      severity:      ["high", "medium"]
      attack_category: ["lateral_movement"]
      attack_type:     ["smb_admin_access", "rdp_lateral"]
      bytes_sent:     ["240", "1024", "4096", "8192", "16384"]
      bytes_received: ["180", "512", "2048", "8192"]
      account_name:   ["j.smith"]
      session_id:     ["VPN-SESS-7f3a9c2b"]
```

**Field semantics:**
- `src_ip` / `src_host` — match the VPN's `assigned_ip` from Stage 3 so the chain links via the session
- `dst_ip` / `dst_host` — three internal high-value targets: domain controller, file server, backup server
- `dst_port` — `445` (SMB), `139` (NetBIOS, often correlated with SMB), `3389` (RDP), `5985` (WinRM) — the "lateral movement" port quartet
- `anomaly_type` — multiple values populate so the SIEM matches whichever taxonomy it uses; some products use `lateral_movement`, others use specific names like `smb_admin_share_access`
- `anomaly_score` — typical NDR confidence range; values 70-91 trigger high-severity rules
- `alert_name` — populate with realistic NDR alert text the SIEM will display
- `account_name` — the username from the VPN session, propagated from Stage 3 — this is what makes the chain attributable to `j.smith`
- `session_id` — same value as Stage 3, so the SIEM can correlate "VPN session VPN-SESS-7f3a9c2b → 100 SMB/RPC anomalies"

**Why this fires the analytics:**
- **Rule #12 (Anomalous Lateral Movement):** the workstation `wks-jsmith-01` has no historical baseline of SMB to `dc01`, RDP to `fs01`, etc. — the NDR's baseline-deviation detector fires. Some products name this differently ("Unusual Internal Connection", "First-Time Admin Share Access") but the analytic family is the same.

**If the operator's stack has no NDR:** substitute with `firewall` internal-zone deny/allow events showing the workstation's east-west traffic. The substitution recipe:

```yaml
xlog.create_data_worker:
  request:
    type:    <stack[firewall].formats[0].upper()>
    vendor:  <stack[firewall].vendor>
    product: <stack[firewall].product>
    count:    100
    interval: 7
    destination: <stack.log_destination.type>
    duration_seconds: 720
    observables_dict:
      src_ip:        ["10.10.20.42"]
      dst_ip:        ["10.10.10.10", "10.10.50.20", "10.10.50.21"]
      dst_port:      ["445", "139", "3389", "5985"]
      protocol:      ["tcp"]
      action:        ["allow"]
      app:           ["smb", "rpc", "ms-rdp", "ms-winrm"]
      bytes_sent:     ["240", "1024", "4096", "8192", "16384"]
      session_state: ["established"]
```

The substitution is weaker — firewall east-west allow events don't fire the lateral-movement rule on their own; they're at best evidence the analyst correlates after another rule fires. **Note this in the post-skill summary** so the operator understands the coverage gap.

## Verification

After running all four stages, the operator should see (within ~5 min of Stage 4 completing):

| Indicator | Where to check |
|---|---|
| ≥1 alert matching "Password Spray" / "Distributed Brute Force" / "Account Enumeration" | XSIAM Issues, last 60 min |
| ≥1 alert matching "Brute Force on Local Account" / "Account Lockout Risk" | XSIAM Issues, last 60 min |
| ≥1 alert matching "Impossible Travel" / "Anomalous Geo Login" | XSIAM Issues, last 60 min |
| ≥1 alert matching "Lateral Movement" / "Unusual Internal Connection" | XSIAM Issues, last 60 min |
| Pivotable correlation: `user=j.smith` + `session_id=VPN-SESS-7f3a9c2b` | XQL query: `dataset = vpn_logs | filter user="j.smith"` then pivot to NDR via session_id |

If any of the four expected alerts is missing, the issue is one of:
- The data class wasn't in the operator's tech stack → check pre-flight output
- The SIEM's parser maps the field names differently → query the raw events with `xsiam.get_issues` and inspect what fields actually got populated
- The threshold for the rule is higher than this skill's volume → bump the relevant stage's `count`

## Tear-down

This skill creates 4 data workers. To stop them mid-run (or to clean up after completion if any are still streaming):

```yaml
xlog.list_workers:
  # returns active worker IDs

xlog.kill_worker:
  worker_id: <each ID returned above>
```

The skill is non-destructive on the SIEM side — the events are already ingested. If the operator wants to suppress the test alerts so they don't pollute real-incident triage, mark them resolved with `xsiam.update_issue` after verification.

## Adapting per deployment

The narrative IPs (`185.220.101.42`, `10.10.0.50`, etc.) and account names (`j.smith`) are illustrative. For exercises tied to a specific customer's environment, the operator can override these via chat ("run the bruteforce_vpn_to_lateral skill but use `bupa.example` user `m.patel` and our actual VPN portal IP `<x>`"). The agent should preserve the chain shape and rule-trigger logic while substituting the requested values.
