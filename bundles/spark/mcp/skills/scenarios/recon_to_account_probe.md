# Skill: External recon → Web app discovery → Account probe

## Category

scenarios

## Attack Type

Pre-exploitation reconnaissance — the phase BEFORE a real attack, where the adversary is mapping the attack surface. Most SOCs ignore recon traffic ("it's just internet noise") and only respond after the actual exploit. This skill demonstrates that recon IS detectable, and detecting it provides early warning days or weeks before a breach.

## XSIAM analytics rules triggered

| # | Rule | Stage |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Account Probing — single source attempting many distinct accounts | Stage 4 |
| 7 | C2 Beaconing (variant: slow recon-style periodic touches) | Stage 1 |
| 8 | Malicious URL via proxy (directory traversal patterns) | Stage 2 |
| 15 | SQL Injection Attempt | Stage 3 |

## Data classes used

| Stage | Data class | If missing |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `firewall` | Required |
| 2 | `proxy` | Substitute with `firewall` (loses URL/payload context) |
| 3 | `waf` | Required for Stage 3 |
| 4 | `vpn` | Substitute with M365/`saas` sign-in failures if no VPN exposed |

## Pre-flight

Call `phantom_get_technology_stack`. All four classes typically exist in a perimeter-savvy stack. If any missing, follow the substitution column.

## Narrative thread

- **Attacker source IP:** `192.0.2.42` (TEST-NET-2 documentation range — replace with a documented threat-intel-sourced IP for real exercises)
- **Internal IP range scanned (Stage 1):** `10.10.30.0/24` (DMZ subnet)
- **Discovered web app (after Stage 1 finds open 443):** `app.bupa.example` at `10.10.30.10`
- **VPN portal (Stage 4 target):** `10.10.0.50`
- **Probed account list:** common admin defaults + plausible firstname.lastname patterns + service account names
- **Wall-clock time:** Stage 1 ~25 min (slow scan to evade thresholds). Stage 2 ~10 min (post-discovery enum). Stage 3 ~12 min (payload recon). Stage 4 ~15 min (account probing). Total: ~62 min — recon is patient.

---

### Stage 1 — Port scan / network discovery — ~250 events over 25 minutes

The attacker scans the public-facing IP range. The firewall sees ~250 inbound connection attempts to varying ports from a single source. Most are denied; a handful (the ones to actual open ports) get through to the destination services. This is intentionally LOW-RATE — fast scans get caught by trivial rate-limit detections, but a scan paced at 1 connection per 6 seconds slips below most thresholds.

**Data class:** `firewall`

```yaml
xlog.create_data_worker:
  request:
    type:    <stack[firewall].formats[0].upper()>
    vendor:  <stack[firewall].vendor>
    product: <stack[firewall].product>
    count:    250
    interval: 6
    destination: <stack.log_destination.type>
    duration_seconds: 1500
    observables_dict:
      src_ip:        ["192.0.2.42"]
      dst_ip:        ["10.10.30.1", "10.10.30.5", "10.10.30.10",
                      "10.10.30.15", "10.10.30.20", "10.10.30.42",
                      "10.10.30.50", "10.10.30.100", "10.10.30.200",
                      "10.10.30.250"]
      dst_port:      ["22", "23", "25", "80", "110", "135", "139",
                      "143", "443", "445", "1433", "3306", "3389",
                      "5432", "5985", "8080", "8443", "9000"]
      src_port:      ["49152", "49251", "49380", "50127", "50882"]
      protocol:      ["tcp"]
      action:        ["deny", "deny", "deny", "allow", "deny"]
      app:           ["unknown", "ssl", "ssh", "http"]
      bytes_sent:    ["64", "0", "120"]
      bytes_received: ["0", "0", "240", "1240"]
      session_state: ["denied", "denied", "established", "denied"]
      country:       ["unknown"]
      tcp_flag:      ["SYN", "SYN", "SYN-ACK"]
      threat_score:  ["35", "60"]
```

**Field semantics:**
- `dst_ip` covers 10 internal IPs in the DMZ — the scan is sweeping the subnet
- `dst_port` covers 18 well-known service ports — characteristic port-knock pattern
- `action: deny` predominates (firewall blocks most), with a few `allow`s for ports that have services listening (e.g. 443 to 10.10.30.10)
- `tcp_flag: SYN` for connection attempts; `SYN-ACK` for the few that get through
- `bytes_sent/received: 0 / 0` for denied (firewall returns nothing); larger for allowed

**Why this fires Rule #7 (slow-burn C2 / scanning variant):** the rule isn't typically named "port scan detected" in modern SIEMs (those are noisy). What DOES fire is a periodic-connection-pattern detection: same source, periodic outbound (~250 connections at ~6s intervals = visible periodicity) — matches the C2-beaconing detection family even though the activity is recon, not actual C2.

### Stage 2 — Directory-traversal & path-enumeration — ~60 events over 10 minutes

After Stage 1 found the web app at `10.10.30.10:443`, the attacker probes for known sensitive paths: `.git/config`, `.env`, `phpmyadmin/`, `wp-admin/`, etc. Most return 404 or 403; a few interesting ones (e.g., `/.well-known/`, `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`) return 200 and leak structure.

**Data class:** `proxy`

```yaml
xlog.create_data_worker:
  request:
    type:    <stack[proxy].formats[0].upper()>
    vendor:  <stack[proxy].vendor>
    product: <stack[proxy].product>
    count:    60
    interval: 10
    destination: <stack.log_destination.type>
    duration_seconds: 600
    observables_dict:
      src_ip:        ["192.0.2.42"]
      dst_ip:        ["10.10.30.10"]
      dst_port:      ["443"]
      url:           ["/.git/config", "/.env", "/.svn/entries",
                      "/phpmyadmin/", "/wp-admin/", "/wp-login.php",
                      "/admin/", "/admin/login.php", "/administrator/",
                      "/phpinfo.php", "/server-status", "/server-info",
                      "/.well-known/security.txt", "/robots.txt",
                      "/sitemap.xml", "/api/v1/users", "/api/v1/admin",
                      "/swagger/", "/swagger.json", "/api-docs",
                      "/backup.sql", "/db.sql", "/config.php.bak",
                      "/index.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd",
                      "/files?path=....//....//....//etc/passwd"]
      method:        ["GET"]
      status_code:   ["404", "403", "200", "301"]
      user_agent:    ["Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64)",
                      "curl/7.81.0",
                      "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Nuclei/3.0; +https://nuclei.projectdiscovery.io)",
                      "ffuf/2.0.0"]
      action:        ["allow", "block"]
      attack_type:   ["directory-traversal", "scanner-fingerprint",
                      "common-vulnerabilities", "path-traversal"]
      bytes_sent:    ["480", "640"]
      bytes_received: ["240", "1280", "4096"]
      category:      ["uncategorized", "newly-registered-domain",
                      "scanner"]
      threat_category: ["suspicious"]
      threat_score:    ["72", "85"]
```

**Field semantics:**
- `url` shows the canonical "common probes" list — `.git/config` (often left exposed), `.env` (database creds in DevOps mistakes), `wp-admin/` (WordPress fingerprint), `swagger/` (API documentation that leaks endpoints), and explicit traversal patterns (`....//....//....//etc/passwd`)
- `user_agent` includes specific scanner fingerprints — `Nuclei`, `ffuf` are well-known security testing tools
- `threat_category: suspicious` — modern proxies enrich with category based on the URL pattern; `directory-traversal` / `scanner-fingerprint` push the score above 70

**Why this fires Rule #8:** the volume + URL category (`scanner` / `directory-traversal`) + suspicious-pattern matches cross the "malicious URL access" threshold. Most SIEMs key on (a) ≥10 distinct suspicious URLs from one source in 10 min, or (b) any single URL matching a high-confidence pattern (e.g. `etc/passwd`).

---

### Stage 3 — WAF-visible payload recon — ~40 events over 12 minutes

The attacker shifts from path enumeration to payload probing. They run sqlmap-like signatures against parameters they discovered in Stage 2 (`?id=`, `?user=`, `?search=`, etc.). Different from `web_app_to_webshell_to_exfil` Stage 1 — that's high-volume blast probing; this is targeted, ~40 carefully-chosen payloads from one source.

**Data class:** `waf`

```yaml
xlog.create_data_worker:
  request:
    type:    <stack[waf].formats[0].upper()>
    vendor:  <stack[waf].vendor>
    product: <stack[waf].product>
    count:    40
    interval: 18
    destination: <stack.log_destination.type>
    duration_seconds: 720
    observables_dict:
      src_ip:        ["192.0.2.42"]
      dst_ip:        ["10.10.30.10"]
      src_port:      ["49152", "51234", "57890"]
      dst_port:      ["443"]
      protocol:      ["tcp"]
      url:           ["/api/v1/users?id=1", "/api/v1/users?id=1'",
                      "/api/v1/users?id=1%20AND%201%3D1--",
                      "/api/v1/users?id=1%20OR%20'a'%3D'a",
                      "/login.php?username=admin'--&password=x",
                      "/search.php?q=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E",
                      "/api/v1/profile?email='%3BSELECT%20pg_sleep(5)--",
                      "/feed.php?id=-1%20UNION%20SELECT%20null,version(),null--"]
      method:        ["GET", "POST"]
      status_code:   ["403", "200", "500"]
      user_agent:    ["sqlmap/1.7.2#stable (https://sqlmap.org)",
                      "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64)",
                      "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; w3af.org)"]
      action:        ["block", "alert", "allow"]
      attack_type:   ["sql-injection", "xss", "command-injection"]
      attack_severity: ["high", "medium"]
      rule_id:       ["942100", "942130", "941100", "942180"]
      rule_name:     ["SQL Injection Attack: Common Injection Testing",
                      "SQL Injection Attack Detected via libinjection",
                      "XSS Attack Detected"]
      bytes_sent:     ["480", "640"]
      bytes_received: ["240", "1280", "4096"]
      threat_score:  ["72", "85", "92"]
```

**Field semantics:** similar to the SQLi probe block in `web_app_to_webshell_to_exfil`, but lower volume (40 events vs 80) and broader payload variety (SQLi + XSS + command-injection probes). The `user_agent` mix shows the attacker rotating tools.

**Why this fires Rule #15:** any modern WAF detects ≥10 SQLi signatures from one source in <30 min. The 40-event burst within 12 min is well above the typical threshold.

---

### Stage 4 — Account probing at the VPN portal — ~80 events over 15 minutes

The attacker has discovered usernames from Stage 2 (e.g., `/api/v1/users` returned 401 with a JSON body like `{"error": "user 'admin' requires authentication"}`). They now probe the VPN auth endpoint with the usernames they discovered, looking for one that doesn't immediately rate-limit.

**Data class:** `vpn`

```yaml
xlog.create_data_worker:
  request:
    type:    <stack[vpn].formats[0].upper()>
    vendor:  <stack[vpn].vendor>
    product: <stack[vpn].product>
    count:    80
    interval: 11
    destination: <stack.log_destination.type>
    duration_seconds: 900
    observables_dict:
      src_ip:                ["192.0.2.42"]
      user:                  ["admin", "administrator", "root", "guest", "test",
                              "demo", "support", "helpdesk", "backup", "operator",
                              "j.smith", "a.jones", "k.taylor", "m.brown", "d.wilson",
                              "alice", "bob", "carol", "diana", "edward",
                              "svc_backup", "svc_sql", "svc_monitor", "svc_ldap",
                              "service", "scanner", "audit", "compliance",
                              "manager", "director", "ceo", "cfo"]
      action:                ["login_failure"]
      authentication_result: ["failed"]
      authentication_method: ["password"]
      error_code:            ["AUTH_FAILED", "INVALID_CREDENTIALS",
                              "USER_NOT_FOUND"]
      vpn_gateway:           ["vpn-portal-01"]
      severity:              ["medium"]
      country:               ["unknown"]
```

**Field semantics:**
- `user` — 32 distinct usernames from one source. `error_code: USER_NOT_FOUND` tells the attacker which usernames don't exist; `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` (vs `USER_NOT_FOUND`) is the leak that the username DOES exist
- `src_ip: 192.0.2.42` — same source as Stages 1-3, completing the "one attacker, end-to-end recon" narrative

**Why this fires Rule #1:** classic account-probing pattern — 32 distinct users from one source in 15 min. Threshold is typically ≥10 users / 5 min from one source. This crosses it 3x over.

## Verification

| Indicator | Where to check |
|---|---|
| Beaconing alert / port-scan alert from `192.0.2.42` | XSIAM Issues |
| Suspicious URL alert: `.env` / `.git/config` / scanner UAs | XSIAM Issues |
| WAF alert: SQLi probes from same source | XSIAM Issues |
| Account-probing alert at VPN | XSIAM Issues |
| Pivotable: filter by `src_ip=192.0.2.42` to see all 4 stages | XQL: `dataset = firewall_logs \| filter src_ip="192.0.2.42"` |

## Tear-down

```yaml
xlog.list_workers:
xlog.kill_worker:
  worker_id: <each>
```

## Adapting per deployment

Replace `192.0.2.42` with a real threat-intel IP if the customer wants their TI integration enriched. The destination `10.10.30.0/24` should be the customer's actual DMZ subnet for realistic detection.
