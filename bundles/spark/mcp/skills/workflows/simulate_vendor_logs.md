# Skill: Simulate vendor-faithful logs

## When this skill applies

The operator names a specific vendor or product in their log-simulation request. Examples:

- "Simulate 50 FortiGate traffic logs"
- "Generate Okta authentication events with these IPs: 192.168.1.100"
- "Create some PaloAlto Networks firewall logs"
- "I need PingFederate audit events for my dashboard"

When the operator's request is GENERIC ("generate 100 syslog messages", "create some incidents", "simulate logs with these observables") — do NOT use this skill. Use `phantom_generate_fake_data` directly with Rosetta's generic universe.

## Why this skill exists

Phantom's default log simulation (`phantom_generate_fake_data`) emits records using Rosetta's predefined field universe. Those records work for generic dashboards but DON'T parse cleanly through Cortex's out-of-the-box ModelingRules — the rule expects FortiGate's `srcip` / `dstip` / `srcport` / `dstport` and gets Rosetta's `local_ip` / `remote_ip`. The XDM mapping silently misses fields.

v0.8.0's Data Sources marketplace solves this. Operators install vendor schemas extracted from Cortex ModelingRule `_schema.json` files. This skill USES those installed schemas — generated records carry the vendor's actual field names, so the matching modeling rule parses them into XDM events correctly. End result: simulated FortiGate traffic shows up in XSIAM's `xdr_data` dataset with proper XDM fields populated.

## Pre-flight — verify a data source is installed

Step 1: call `data_sources_list` (optionally filtered) to see what schemas the operator has installed.

```
data_sources_list(filter="<vendor name from the operator's prompt>")
```

Decision tree based on the response:

- **Exactly 1 result + names match the operator's intent** → use it.
- **Multiple results** → pick the best match by pack_name then dataset_name. Prefer non-rawlog rows (`is_rawlog_only=false`) — rawlog-only schemas can't be used as schema_override yet (Phase 1.5 work).
- **No results** → tell the operator:
  > "No installed data source matches '<vendor>'. Open /data-sources, click Browse, and install a matching schema — or fall back to Rosetta with `phantom_generate_fake_data` if a generic format is acceptable."
  >
  > Then STOP. Don't auto-install — operator should explicitly opt into the install via the UI or by saying "yes install it".

## Step 1 — Resolve the schema

Once you have the chosen `data_source_id`, fetch the full schema:

```
data_sources_get_schema(data_source_id="<id from list>")
```

Response shape:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data_source": {
    "id": "FortiGate/FortiGate_1_3/fortinet_fortigate_raw",
    "pack_name": "FortiGate",
    "rule_name": "FortiGate_1_3",
    "dataset_name": "fortinet_fortigate_raw",
    "field_count": 176,
    "non_meta_field_count": 172,
    "is_rawlog_only": false,
    "fields": [
      { "name": "_id",    "type": "string",   "is_meta": true,  "is_array": false },
      { "name": "_time",  "type": "datetime", "is_meta": true,  "is_array": false },
      { "name": "srcip",  "type": "string",   "is_meta": false, "is_array": false },
      { "name": "dstip",  "type": "string",   "is_meta": false, "is_array": false },
      { "name": "srcport","type": "int",      "is_meta": false, "is_array": false },
      ...
    ],
    "xdm_mappings": []
  }
}
```

If `is_rawlog_only` is true, STOP and tell the operator:
> "FortiGate's schema is rawlog-only — Phantom can't generate structured vendor-faithful logs for it yet (deferred to Phase 1.5). Falling back to Rosetta's generic CEF/syslog format."

Then call `phantom_generate_fake_data` with `type="CEF"` and a reasonable vendor/product as a degraded-mode response.

## Step 2 — Call generate_fake_data_v2 with the schema override

Build the `schema_override` parameter from the schema you just loaded. Pass ALL fields including meta (the v2 layer omits meta automatically). Don't transform the field shape — pass each field as `{name, type, is_array, is_meta}` directly.

```
xlog_generate_fake_data_v2(
  request={
    "type": "JSON",
    "count": <operator's count, default 10>,
    "vendor": "<schema.pack_name>",
    "product": "<schema.pack_name>",
    "datetime_iso": "<optional — caller may want a specific time window>",
    "observables_dict": "<optional — caller passes specific IPs/users if the prompt mentions them>"
  },
  schema_override={
    "vendor_fields": [
      { "name": "<f.name>", "type": "<f.type>", "is_array": <f.is_array>, "is_meta": <f.is_meta> }
      for f in schema.fields
    ],
    "dataset_name": "<schema.dataset_name>",
    "pack_name": "<schema.pack_name>",
    "rule_name": "<schema.rule_name>"
  }
)
```

Use `type: "JSON"` regardless of what the operator said unless they explicitly asked for CEF/Syslog/LEEF — the v2 path emits JSON records keyed by vendor field names. Wire-format wrapping is the operator's concern, not the schema's.

## Step 3 — Report back to the operator

When the response comes back:

- `schema_applied: true` → tell the operator which schema was used + the record count:
  > "Generated 50 vendor-faithful logs using the **FortiGate** schema (172 vendor fields from FortiGate_1_3 / fortinet_fortigate_raw). Sample record: `{srcip: "10.0.0.42", dstip: "203.0.113.5", srcport: 41872, dstport: 443, action: "allow", ...}`. Cortex's FortiGate ModelingRule will parse these into XDM events when sent to XSIAM."

- `schema_applied: false` + `fallback_reason` is set → explain what fell back:
  > "Schema override didn't apply (`<fallback_reason>`). Generated logs use Rosetta's generic field universe instead — the FortiGate ModelingRule won't parse them. Investigate via /data-sources."

## End-to-end smoke (operator verification)

The full path to verify v0.8.0 is shipping correctly:

1. Open `/data-sources`, click Browse, install **FortiGate / FortiGate_1_3** (Install button on the dataset row).
2. In chat, say: *"Simulate 50 FortiGate traffic logs."*
3. Agent should respond with 50 records whose keys include `srcip`, `dstip`, `srcport`, `dstport`, `action`, etc. — NOT Rosetta's `local_ip`/`remote_ip`.
4. (Optional — full XSIAM path): pipe the records into the operator's XSIAM webhook via `create_data_worker` and verify they land in `xdr_data` as XDM events.

## Forbidden under this skill

- **Don't auto-install missing data sources.** When the operator names a vendor with no installed schema, surface the gap + point them at `/data-sources` Browse. Auto-install would burn API quota + commit to a schema the operator hasn't reviewed.
- **Don't transform field names.** Pass them verbatim from `data_sources_get_schema`. The whole point is preserving the vendor's actual naming so the modeling rule's mapping fires.
- **Don't pass observables_dict that doesn't match the schema's field names.** Observables only override when the field name in the schema matches the key in observables_dict. Mismatched keys are silently ignored.
