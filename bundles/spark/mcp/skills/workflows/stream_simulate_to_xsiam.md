# Skill: Stream simulated logs to Cortex XSIAM (end-to-end)

## When this skill applies

The operator's request combines BOTH:

1. **Simulation** — "send", "stream", "simulate", "fire", "generate" logs for a named vendor
2. **XSIAM target** — "to XSIAM", "to my tenant", "into XSIAM", or "and confirm they arrived" / "and verify them"

Examples that match:
- *"Send Okta SSO logs to my XSIAM."*
- *"Stream AWS CloudTrail traffic into my tenant and confirm they landed."*
- *"Fire 50 ServiceNow events and verify XDM populated."*
- *"Simulate Azure WAF logs in XSIAM."*

Examples that do **not** match (route elsewhere):
- *"Just generate 50 FortiGate records — I'll review them locally."* → `simulate_vendor_logs` (returns records to chat; no XSIAM round-trip)
- *"Did my last kill chain show up in XDR?"* → `xdr_verify_simulation_telemetry` (verification only, no new simulation)

## Why this skill exists

The agent's chat path can drive `phantom_create_data_worker` via MCP (v0.17.78). But to land events in the **right** XSIAM dataset, the chat needs to:

1. **Discover** which dataset the operator means
2. **Translate display names to broker-routing values** (v0.17.79). The operator's XSIAM tenant's installed parsing rules filter on specific CEF vendor/product literals that frequently differ from the YAML's display name (`Amazon Web Services` / `AWS-CloudTrail` derives `amazon_web_services_aws_cloudtrail_raw` at the broker, but the operator's PR routes from `amazon` / `aws` → `amazon_aws_raw`)
3. **Set the right discriminator** for multi-dataset packs (Okta SSO uses `eventType=user.authentication.sso`; O365 Exchange uses `Workload=Exchange`; Azure AKS uses `category=kube-audit`)
4. **Verify** with the right XQL query type (`dataset = X` for raw landing; `datamodel dataset = X` for XDM saturation — they're different views and return different things)

This skill encodes those decisions so the chat doesn't re-derive them per session.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Discover the data source

Call `data_sources_list` filtered by what the operator named:

```
data_sources_list(filter="<vendor or product the operator named>")
```

Decision tree:
- **Exactly 1 result + names match the operator's intent** → use it. Note its `pack_name`, `rule_name`, `dataset_name`.
- **Multiple results** — narrow by what the operator emphasized (sub-product, workload, audit-vs-sign-in, etc.). If still ambiguous, ASK the operator which one before continuing.
- **No results** → tell the operator: *"No installed data source matches '<vendor>'. Open /data-sources, click Browse, and install the matching schema first."* STOP. Don't auto-install.

### Step 2 — Fetch the full schema + how_to_use guidance

```
data_sources_get_schema(
  data_source_id="<pack_name>/<rule_name>/<dataset_name> from step 1",
  compact=true     # ⚠️ REQUIRED — see the compact note below
)
```

**⚠️ ALWAYS pass `compact=true` here (v0.17.x).** With descriptions, a large
vendor's schema (SentinelOne ~105 fields, Zscaler ~108) exceeds the agent's
tool-result size cap, so the field list arrives TRUNCATED mid-way — you then
forward an incomplete `schema_override` and the worker silently emits a partial
event, capping XDM (the back half of the list, where nested-JSON composites
live, never reaches you). `compact=true` returns only `name`/`type`/`is_array`/
`is_meta` — exactly what `schema_override` consumes (xlog discards the rest
anyway) — so the WHOLE field list fits. SentinelOne XDM went **0 → mapped** once
the complete field list reached the worker.

The response carries:
- `fields[]` — the full vendor field schema (with `compact=true` each entry is
  `{name, type, is_array, is_meta}`). Pass it **verbatim and complete** as
  `schema_override` to the worker.
- `how_to_use` — markdown with the **"Sending these logs to Cortex XSIAM"** sub-section (v0.17.79+) that names the EXACT CEF vendor + product values to use and any discriminator field requirements. **The modeling-rule GATE seed lives here** (`how_to_use` is preserved under `compact=true`), so you don't need per-field descriptions to seed the gate.

**Critical**: parse `how_to_use` to extract the CEF routing values. They appear as:

```
**Required CEF header for XSIAM**:

- **vendor**: `<cef_vendor>`
- **product**: `<cef_product>`
```

Use those literal values for the worker's `vendor` + `product` arguments — NOT the YAML's top-level `vendor` / `product` (those are operator-facing display names that frequently differ from the broker-routing values).

For multi-dataset packs, also extract any discriminator field guidance — strings like:
- `eventType=user.authentication.sso` → must be in the synthetic event's payload
- `Workload=Exchange` → ditto
- `category=AuditLogs` → ditto

These are PR-side filters; without them, events fall through to a sibling dataset.

### Step 3 — Resolve the operator's XSIAM broker destination

Default broker destination: `udp:10.10.0.8:514`. If the operator has named log destinations configured, prefer the one with `type_id=syslog`:

```
log_destinations_list(filter="syslog")
```

Pick the destination matching the operator's intent or default to `udp:10.10.0.8:514`.

### Step 4 — Fire `phantom_create_data_worker`

**Fire directly — do NOT re-confirm.** If this skill is active, the operator already said "send / stream / fire / simulate" — that IS your go-ahead. Call `phantom_create_data_worker` now; never pause to ask "shall I fire it?" or print "about to call …" and stop. The operator asked you to send the logs — send them.

**⚠️ MANDATORY for XDM — seed the modeling-rule GATE field via `observables_dict`.** Every modeling rule opens with `filter <field> = "<value>"` (or `… in (…)`). If your event does not carry that EXACT value, the rule **never fires and XDM stays 0** even though raw landing succeeds — this is the #1 cause of "0 XDM". Find the gate field from `data_sources_get_schema`: it is the field whose `description` begins **"Modeling-rule GATE — must equal …"** (or read `how_to_use`'s "Make it map to XDM" line, or the L21 table below). You MUST pass that field+value in `observables_dict` on EVERY simulate-and-verify run. Proven live: Azure FlowLogs over CEF went from **0 → 25+ `xdm.*` fields** the instant `observables_dict={"category":["NetworkSecurityGroupFlowEvent"]}` was added. Never fire `phantom_create_data_worker` for an XDM run without seeding the gate. (Exception: a few sources gate on a `_`-prefixed META field like `_log_type` that the broker/collector stamps at onboarding — not settable from the payload; their `how_to_use` says so. Raw lands; XDM there needs the operator's source onboarding, not a seed.)

**Use the EXACT `vendor` / `product` literals from Step 2 — never invent or prettify them from the source's friendly/display name.** For the "Okta — SSO" data source the product is `Okta` (NOT `Okta SSO`) — "Okta SSO" is a UI label, not a CEF value. The SSO-vs-System-Log split is driven by the `eventType` discriminator in `observables_dict`, NOT the product string. Same trap for any multi-word/sub-product source: pass the literal `product` field from `data_sources_get_schema`, not a derived name.

```
phantom_create_data_worker(
  type="CEF",
  destination="<udp:host:port from step 3>",
  count=3,                       # 3 events per tick is plenty for verification
  interval=2,                    # 2-second tick keeps total UDP volume low
  vendor="<cef_vendor from how_to_use>",     # NOT the display name
  product="<cef_product from how_to_use>",   # NOT the display name
  schema_override=<the COMPLETE compact fields[] from data_sources_get_schema(compact=true)>,
  observables_dict=<see below>,  # MANDATORY for XDM — seed the GATE field (see ⚠️ block above)
)
```

**For multi-dataset packs**, set the discriminator value via `observables_dict`:

```python
observables_dict={
  "eventType": ["user.authentication.sso"],     # Okta SSO
  # or
  "Workload": ["Exchange"],                     # O365 Exchange
  # or
  "category": ["kube-apiserver"],               # Azure AKS (NOT kube-audit)
  # or
  "category": ["AuditLogs"],                    # Entra ID audit
}
```

**Beyond multi-dataset routing, ALSO seed the MR's XDM classifier here** (L21) — e.g. `eventType` for Okta, `event_type` for Qualys/Proofpoint, `Category` for Azure WAF, `auditCode` for CyberArk. Without a valid classifier value the MR drops the event and XDM stays 0 even though raw landing succeeds.

If the worker creation succeeds, capture `worker_id` (the `worker` field in the response) for later cleanup.

### Step 5 — Wait for XSIAM ingest

XSIAM ingest typically lands events in 30-120 seconds after they reach the broker. Wait at least 90 seconds before querying — querying too early means an empty result that's not a real signal.

If the orchestration session is interactive: tell the operator *"Streaming now. Ingest typically lands within 60-120s — I'll check back in ~90 seconds."*

### ⚠️ Tool selection — read before Step 6

The agent's catalog exposes TWO XQL-shaped tools because two Cortex connectors are installed:

| Tool | Connector | Tenant URL pattern | Use for THIS skill? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`xsiam_run_xql_query`** | xsiam | `https://api-<operator>.xdr.<region>.paloaltonetworks.com` | ✅ **YES — only this one** |
| `xdr_run_xql_query` / `xdr_xql_run_query` / `xdr_xql_get_results` / `xdr_xql_list_datasets` | cortex-xdr | A DIFFERENT Cortex tenant (legacy XDR product) | ❌ NEVER for THIS skill |

**Why this matters**: the skill simulates logs to the operator's XSIAM broker, which lands them in their XSIAM tenant. Querying via `xdr_*` tools hits the cortex-xdr connector instance, which routes to a different Cortex tenant entirely — frequently returning 500 errors or empty results because the data lives elsewhere. The smoke that motivated this section (session `713c3a9e`, 2026-05-28) burned 20 tool calls and reported "couldn't verify XDM" purely because of this tool mis-selection.

**Hard rule**: every XQL call in this skill — Step 6 raw verification, Step 7 datamodel verification, troubleshooting queries — MUST use `xsiam_run_xql_query`. If the tool isn't available in the agent's catalog, surface the gap to the operator (xsiam connector not configured); do NOT fall back to `xdr_*` variants.

### Step 6 — Verify raw landing

```
xsiam_run_xql_query(
  query="dataset = <dataset_name> | sort desc _time | limit 5",
  tenant_timeframe={"relativeTime": 600000}  # last 10 minutes
)
```

Inspect the result:
- `reply.status == "SUCCESS"` and `reply.number_of_results > 0` → events landed. Note the `_time` field on the most recent row; if it's after the worker creation time, those rows came from THIS run.
- `reply.number_of_results == 0` → events did NOT land in this dataset. Likely causes (in priority order):
  1. **Wrong CEF vendor/product** — re-read `how_to_use`, double-check the literal values
  2. **Wrong discriminator** for multi-dataset packs — re-read `how_to_use` for the PR filter requirements
  3. **Operator's broker has an applet/filter** that intercepts these events. Ask the operator to check `XSIAM → Settings → Broker → Applets` for any rule matching this vendor.
  4. **Broker auto-derives a different dataset name** — try querying `dataset = <broker-derived name>` as a fallback (e.g. `amazon_web_services_aws_cloudtrail_raw` for AWS CT)
- `reply.status == "FAIL"` or error → the dataset doesn't exist in this tenant. Tell the operator: *"The dataset `<X>` isn't registered in your XSIAM tenant. Install the upstream Cortex Marketplace pack for this vendor first."*

### Step 7 — Verify XDM materialization (datamodel view)

If raw landing succeeded, also check whether the modeling rule populated XDM fields:

```
xsiam_run_xql_query(
  query="datamodel dataset = <dataset_name> | sort desc _time | fields xdm.* | limit 1",
  tenant_timeframe={"relativeTime": 600000}
)
```

L13 critical: `dataset = X` returns RAW columns; `datamodel dataset = X` returns the MR-transformed XDM view. Both queries must succeed for full saturation.

Report the XDM saturation count to the operator:
- *"✅ 5 events landed in `okta_okta_raw` (raw), and XDM materialized 17 fields including `xdm.event.outcome`, `xdm.source.user.username`, `xdm.observer.product`. End-to-end pipeline verified."*

### Step 8 — Cleanup

Stop the worker so it doesn't keep emitting after the verification:

```
phantom_list_workers()
# find the worker by `name` matching what you captured in Step 4
phantom_kill_worker(worker_id="<from list_workers>")
```

## Lessons learned to honor (L1–L20)

These are 20 specific findings from the R5 / v0.17.75-79 smoke runs. Encoded so the chat doesn't re-discover them:

**L1 — `call <RULE>` chains imply field inheritance.** Per-dataset MRs that `call ngfw_standalone` inherit every field that helper reads — don't skip the helper's fields when assembling schema_override.

**L7 — XQL `status=FAIL` vs `SUCCESS, n=0` differ semantically.** `FAIL` = dataset doesn't exist in this tenant (PR not installed). `SUCCESS, n=0` = dataset exists but no events match the filter (routing gap). Report each differently to the operator.

**L12 — CEF over UDP is the universal transport.** Even JSON-native vendors (Okta, AWS CT, Azure AD) can be CEF-wrapped: pack their named fields as CEF extension k=v pairs; the same PR/MR fires regardless of transport.

**L13 — `dataset =` returns RAW columns only.** `datamodel dataset =` returns the XDM view. Use BOTH to verify the path end-to-end. A successful raw-landing query with `xdm.* = NULL` means the MR didn't fire — **post-v0.17.104 the #1 cause is a missing classifier value** (the MR's `filter <field> in (…)` rejected the event; see L21), NOT composite synthesis (fixed in v0.17.104).

**L15 — Nested JSON survives CEF extension wrapping.** Pack composite fields like `actor` as JSON-string CEF extensions: `actor={"id":"...","alternateId":"a@b.com"}`. The MR's `json_extract_scalar(actor, "$.alternateId")` parses at query time.

**L17 — PR filter rejection is vendor-specific.** "dataset exists, n=0" most often means the PR's filter (timestamp shape, discriminator field, computed value) didn't match. The CEF wrapping pattern itself is fine; tune the synthetic event per-vendor.

**L18 — UDP MTU 1500 is a hard ceiling.** Saturating events > 1500 bytes get truncated by the broker. Keep single events to ~25-30 CEF extensions. For more XDM coverage, split into 2-3 events sharing a marker.

**L19 — CEF JSON values become STRING columns, not JSON-typed columns.** MR functions expecting JSON-typed inputs (`object_create`, `field -> sub`, array indexing) may return null. Prefer SHALLOW CEF extensions mapping to flat MR field reads.

**L20 — [SUPERSEDED by L21, v0.17.104] Nested-JSON used to cap at ~10.** Pre-v0.17.104 the generator emitted composite (`type: json`) fields as RANDOM STRINGS, so `json_extract_scalar` returned null and nested-JSON MRs ceilinged at ~10. **v0.17.104 fixed this** — composites now synthesize as real nested JSON from their dotted-leaf children. Measured ceilings are now far higher: Okta 46, O365 General 52, Azure Flow Logs 48, Entra ID 44. Do NOT pre-emptively split nested-JSON vendors expecting a ~10 cap.

**v0.17.79 — Broker auto-route mismatches YAML name.** The CEF header's vendor + product values normalize to `<lowercased-vendor>_<lowercased-product>_raw`. The YAML's `dataset_name` field is what the operator's PR ROUTES to — these names often differ. Always read `how_to_use` for the CEF literal values that produce the YAML's expected dataset, not the YAML's `vendor`/`product` display fields.

**L21 — Seed the MR's classifier field, or XDM stays 0 (v0.17.104–106 campaign).** Many modeling rules open with `filter <field> in (<allow-list>)` — if that classifier field carries a random value, the MR drops the event and XDM is 0 *even though raw landing succeeded*. Before simulating, read the source's `how_to_use` (and, if available, the MR) for the classifier the rule keys on, and seed a VALID value via `observables_dict`. This is the single biggest XDM-saturation lever. Validated examples (0 → high XDM):

| Vendor | Seed via `observables_dict` |
|---|---|
| Okta (System Log) | `eventType=user.session.start` (any non-SSO Okta event) |
| Okta SSO | `eventType=user.authentication.sso` |
| Alibaba ActionTrail | `event_eventtype=ApiCall` |
| Proofpoint Email | `event_type=message` |
| Qualys | `event_type=activity_log` |
| Azure Flow Logs | `category=NetworkSecurityGroupFlowEvent` |
| Azure WAF | `Category=FrontDoorAccessLog` |
| Azure AKS | `category=kube-apiserver` (NOT `kube-audit`) |
| CyberArk ISP | `auditCode=IDP2005` (sets `is_auth=true`) |

If the value isn't in `how_to_use`, the field's `description` usually lists valid examples — pick one. Pass it as `observables_dict={"<field>": ["<value>"]}` (a single-element list is unwrapped to the scalar).

**L22 — Pass the FULL `fields[]`, never a trimmed subset.** Hand `data_sources_get_schema`'s entire `fields[]` to `schema_override` verbatim — flat fields, top-level composites (`type: json`), AND their dotted-leaf children. The generator synthesizes each composite's nested object FROM its dotted leaves (v0.17.104), so dropping leaves starves the composite. More fields mapped = more XDM. The operator's intent is maximum field coverage — don't pre-trim to "save bytes" (split into 2 events sharing a marker if you hit the 1500-byte MTU, per L18, rather than dropping fields).

**L23 — Fetch the schema with `compact=true`, or large vendors silently truncate (v0.17.x, #116).** `data_sources_get_schema` defaults to verbose (per-field `description` + `example`) for the UI. For a 100+-field vendor that payload exceeds the agent's tool-result size cap, so the field list you receive is TRUNCATED mid-way — you then forward an incomplete `schema_override` and XDM caps or stays 0 even though raw landing succeeds. This is NOT a trim-to-save-bytes choice (L22 still holds — pass ALL fields); it's that the verbose payload literally doesn't fit. `compact=true` returns only the 4 keys the worker uses (`name`/`type`/`is_array`/`is_meta`), so the COMPLETE list fits and reaches the worker. Symptom this prevents: SentinelOne landed 350k raw rows but mapped 0 XDM because only ~33 of 105 fields survived truncation; with `compact=true` the full schema arrives and the nested Threat-branch composites map. `how_to_use` (gate seed + CEF routing) is preserved under compact, so nothing else in this skill changes.

**L24 — Verifying fresh XDM in a polluted dataset (v0.17.121, #116 retro).** Once a tenant holds days of test data, naive verification lies — three rules keep it honest: **(a) isolate fresh events with `sort desc _time`.** `datamodel dataset = X | sort desc _time | fields xdm.* | limit 50` reads THIS run's events; a bare `| fields xdm.* | limit 40` samples arbitrary old rows and under-reports (it falsely showed 0 in the retro). **(b) Do NOT filter on `xdm.event.type != null` as a universal "mapped" proxy.** Firewall/endpoint rules (FortiGate, MS Windows) never set `xdm.event.type` — they map `xdm.event.outcome` / `xdm.event.id` instead — so that filter returns ZERO rows for them and looks like total failure. Count DISTINCT non-null `xdm.*` columns across the recent rows instead. **(c) Prove freshness from the data, not the query** — report the newest row's `_time` and confirm it falls in your run window; a relativeTime param alone may not isolate (it returned dataset totals in the retro). Validated fresh ceilings under this method: **FortiGate 76, Salesforce 43, SentinelOne 34 (2-event split), MS Windows 29, Zscaler 17.**

## Quick reference — the 22 validated vendors

The R5 smoke run validated these vendors end-to-end. Routing values are baked in each YAML's `how_to_use`; this table is a convenient summary:

| Vendor (data source) | CEF vendor → product | Multi-dataset discriminator |
|---|---|---|
| Okta okta_okta_raw | `Okta` → `Okta` | (default) |
| Okta SSO | `Okta` → `Okta` | `eventType=user.authentication.sso` or `user.session.start` |
| Alibaba ActionTrail | `alibaba` → `action_trail` | — |
| AWS CloudTrail (amazon_aws_raw) | `amazon` → `aws` | — |
| AWS Security Hub | `aws` → `security_hub` | — |
| AWS WAF | `aws` → `waf` | — |
| Jira | `Atlassian` → `Jira` | — |
| ServiceNow | `ServiceNow` → `ServiceNow` | — |
| CyberArk ISP | `cyberark` → `isp` | — |
| Entra ID audit | `msft` → `azure_ad_audit` | `category=AuditLogs` |
| Entra ID sign-in | `msft` → `azure_ad` | `category=SignInLogs` |
| O365 General | `msft` → `o365_general` | — |
| O365 Exchange | `msft` → `o365_exchange_online` | `Workload=Exchange` |
| O365 SharePoint | `msft` → `o365_sharepoint_online` | `Workload=SharePoint` |
| O365 Emails | `msft` → `o365_emails` | `Operation=EmailEvent` |
| O365 DLP | `msft` → `o365_dlp` | `Workload=DLP` |
| Qualys | `Qualys` → `Qualys` | — |
| ProofPoint Email | `proofpoint` → `email_security` | — |
| ProofPoint TAP | `Proofpoint` → `TAP` | — |
| Azure Flow Logs | `msft` → `azure_flowlogs` | — |
| Azure WAF | `msft` → `azure_waf` | — |
| Azure AKS | `msft` → `azure_aks` | `category=kube-apiserver` (control-plane category; NOT `kube-audit`) |

For vendors not in this table, fall back to `data_sources_get_schema` + parse `how_to_use` — every v0.17.79+ data source YAML carries the routing guidance.

## Forbidden under this skill

- **Don't query XSIAM before waiting at least 90s.** Ingest latency is real; querying too early reports a false negative. Tell the operator you're waiting.
- **Don't tell the operator events landed without RUNNING the verification query.** Worker creation success ≠ landing success. Always run Step 6 + 7.
- **Don't use the YAML's top-level `vendor` / `product` for `phantom_create_data_worker` arguments.** Parse `how_to_use` for the CEF routing literals. Using display names will route to the wrong dataset (sometimes silently — events land in `unknown_unknown_raw` or `<display-vendor>_<display-product>_raw` which isn't where the operator's PRs route from).
- **Don't auto-install missing Cortex Marketplace packs.** XSIAM dataset registration is operator-owned. If the dataset doesn't exist, surface the gap + point to the Marketplace.
- **Don't claim XDM saturation without running `datamodel dataset = X | fields xdm.*`.** Raw landing ≠ XDM materialization. The MR transforms raw into XDM lazily.
- **Don't leave workers running after verification.** They keep emitting UDP at the broker. Always call `phantom_kill_worker` in Step 8.
- **Don't use any `xdr_*_xql_*` tool for verification.** Those route to the cortex-xdr connector → a DIFFERENT Cortex tenant from the operator's XSIAM. Use `xsiam_run_xql_query` exclusively. See the "Tool selection" callout above Step 6.

## Output template (operator-facing)

```
**Streaming `<vendor>` logs to Cortex XSIAM**

1. ✅ Discovered data source `<dataset_name>` (pack: `<pack_name>`, rule: `<rule_name>`)
2. ✅ Routing values from how_to_use: vendor=`<cef_vendor>`, product=`<cef_product>` <discriminator if any>
3. ✅ Worker created: `<worker_id>` streaming CEF to `<destination>` at <count>/2s
4. ⏳ Waiting 90s for XSIAM ingest...
5. <verify result>:
   - ✅ **Raw landing**: <N> events in `<dataset_name>` since worker start
   - ✅ **XDM materialization**: <M> XDM fields populated, including: <list top 8>
6. ✅ Worker stopped (`<worker_id>`)

End-to-end pipeline verified for **<vendor>**.
```

If any step fails, replace ✅ with ❌ + report the specific diagnostic + next-step suggestion (re-read how_to_use, install Cortex pack, check broker applets, etc.).
