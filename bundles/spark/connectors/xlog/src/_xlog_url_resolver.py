"""Resolve the xlog GraphQL base URL for xlog connector tools.

The same xlog tool functions are invoked from two runtimes today:

1. **Agent's embedded MCP** (`bundles/spark/mcp/`) — lifespan_context has
   a `get_xlog_url()` callable (set in
   `bundles/spark/mcp/src/service/phantom_mcp/server.py`) that reads from
   `InstanceStore.list_for("xlog")[0].config.baseUrl` live, so it picks
   up changes without restart.

2. **Per-instance connector container** (`phantom-connector-runtime`) — the
   runtime entrypoint stashes the connector's instance config in a
   contextvar via `config.set_current_instance(...)`. Tools read it via
   `config.get_config().<key>`. The `get_xlog_url` lifespan key is NOT
   populated here (the runtime is connector-agnostic; it doesn't know
   which connectors expose which keys).

Pre-v0.17.77, xlog tools called `lifespan_context["get_xlog_url"]()`
directly — which works in runtime #1 but raises KeyError in runtime #2.
This helper detects which runtime is current and returns the right URL.

Recommended call site:

    from ._xlog_url_resolver import resolve_xlog_url
    client = PhantomGraphQLClient(resolve_xlog_url(ctx))

The function takes the FastMCP `Context` so it can probe lifespan_context
without callers having to do the dict lookup themselves.

    """Return the xlog GraphQL base URL, working in either runtime.

    Resolution order:
      1. If lifespan_context has a `get_xlog_url` callable (agent runtime),
         call it and return the result.
      2. Otherwise (per-instance connector runtime), read `baseUrl` from
         the current instance's config via the runtime's contextvar.
      3. If neither succeeds, raise RuntimeError with a clear message so
         the operator sees what's wrong.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: when both resolution paths fail. Common cause: the
            connector code is running outside the per-instance runtime
            AND outside the agent's MCP (e.g., a stand-alone test harness
            that didn't set up either).
