    Record a detection validation result for a completed or running Phantom simulation.

    Use this after running XSIAM queries or reviewing generated alerts. The result is
    persisted in Phantom and contributes to the coverage report.

    REQUIRED PARAMETER: `simulation_id` (a Phantom run id like `sim_abc123def456`).
    This tool does NOT accept ATT&CK technique ids directly. If the operator asks to
    validate "T1078" (or any technique), call `phantom_generate_coverage_report` first
    with `include_simulations=true`, find the most recent run whose
    `attack.technique_id` matches, and pass its `id` here.

    TYPICAL WORKFLOW:
      1. phantom_generate_coverage_report(include_simulations=true) → list of sim runs
      2. Pick the relevant simulation_id from the returned list
      3. phantom_run_detection_validation(
             simulation_id=<picked id>,
             expected={"alert": "<rule name>", "technique_id": "T1078"},
