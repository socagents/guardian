"""Reference connector — minimal demo_echo tool.

Demonstrates the runtime contract:
  * Public function in connector.py exposed via __all__.
  * Reads per-instance config via `from config.config import get_config`
    (the runtime's contextvar shim — same API as in-process loader).
  * Returns a dict that flows back through the agent's MCP proxy
    unchanged.
  * Uses async (FastMCP supports both sync + async; async is the
    convention in Phantom's connector code).

Naming: function is `phantom__runtime_demo_echo`. The runtime
entrypoint strips the `phantom__runtime_` prefix at registration
time, so the agent's MCP proxy sees the tool as `demo_echo`. This
matches how web uses `phantom_web_<tool>`. Either prefix style
works; the runtime handles them all.
