# Pre-v0.5.80 caldera relied on the runtime's auto-discovery fallback

# cortex-xdr v0.5.75. With `__all__` declared, the runtime uses the

    pattern as cortex-xdr v0.5.77 — the connector runs in a separate

    under /app/. The agent-side `usecase/` module isn't available
    there; pre-v0.5.80 the import crashed every caldera tool call
    with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'usecase'`.

    The connector-runtime's `_load_instance` opens the container-local
    `InstanceStoreReader` against /app/data/instances.db, resolves
    secrets via `SecretStoreReader`, merges them into a flat dict,
    and stashes the dict on a contextvar via `set_current_instance`.
    `get_config()` returns a `_ConfigProxy` over that dict. Connector

    Wait until a Caldera operation's chain grows or it actually completes.

    v0.6.32 introduced this tool; v0.6.33 fixes the false-completion bug.

    LLMs can't sleep between tool calls; if the agent just keeps
    calling `caldera_get_operation_by_id` in a tight loop, it
    polls 10 times in 2 minutes and hits the chat handler's
    `max_turns` cap before any Caldera ability has fired (each
    ability takes 30-60s real-time after the agent beacons).

    This tool DOES the sleep server-side. The connector container
    polls Caldera every ~6 seconds for up to `timeout_seconds`,
    returning AS SOON AS:
      - the chain length exceeds `last_chain_length` (a new ability
        completed), OR
      - the outer `state` shifts to a TRUE terminal value
        (`finished`/`cleanup`/`out_of_time`) AND chain is fully
        populated, OR
      - `timeout_seconds` elapses (the caller decides whether
        to continue waiting).

    v0.6.33 — DON'T treat `state=paused` as terminal. Caldera's
    atomic planner uses `paused` BETWEEN ability dispatches (not
    just at end of operation): the planner sends ability A1 to
    agent X, marks the operation `paused` while the agent beacons
    + executes + reports, then transitions back to `running` to
    dispatch A2. The v0.6.32 tool's `paused` → terminal mapping
    caused the kill-chain agent to exit polling at minute ~10,
    convinced the chain was done when it had actually only fired
    ~6 of 20 abilities. Discovered post-3rd-run: Caldera said
    `state=running, chain.length=40` while the agent had reported
    "20 steps successfully executed" based on its last wait result
    of `state=paused, chain=6 entries`.

    v0.6.33 distinguishes paused-mid-run from end-of-operation by
    using `expected_total_abilities`:
      - If 0 (caller doesn't know): never treat `paused` as terminal.
        Only stop on `finished`/`cleanup`/`out_of_time`. Chain
        completion signal is `last_chain_length` growing.
      - If > 0 (caller knows the adversary's atomic_ordering length;
        for the kill chain this is 20 abilities × N agents):
        terminal only when state in {finished, cleanup, out_of_time}
        OR chain has reached the expected count.

    Note: Caldera's `auto_close=false` (default) keeps an operation
    `state=running` indefinitely after the chain completes. Callers
    should NOT wait for `state=finished` — use the chain-length
    signal AND the expected total. v0.6.33 reflects this.

    Args:
        id: UUID of the operation to wait on.
        last_chain_length: How many chain entries the agent last
            saw. Pass 0 on the first call; pass `len(result.chain)`
            on subsequent calls.
        expected_total_abilities: How many chain entries indicate
            full completion. For the run_phishing_kill_chain skill
            this is `20 * number_of_agents_in_operation_group` (40
            with both agents in group=red). 0 means "don't know;
            rely on terminal state only".
        timeout_seconds: Hard upper bound on the wait. Default 90;
            clamped to [5, 180].
        poll_interval_seconds: Internal poll cadence. Default 6;
            clamped to [2, 30].

    Returns:
        v0.6.34 — a COMPACT summary, NOT the full Caldera operation
        object. Pre-v0.6.34 the tool returned the raw ~50KB
        operation blob; LLMs misread it (counting the adversary's
        atomic_ordering of 20 ability IDs as "chain has 20 entries"
        when chain actually had 2). The compact form is <2KB:

          {
