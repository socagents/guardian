"""Fire-and-forget audit-event forwarder for connector containers.

When a connector tool wants to write an audit row (e.g.
"agent_self_mod_executed", "tool_call_with_outcome"), it calls
`record_event()` here. The forwarder POSTs to the agent's
`/api/v1/audit` endpoint via the URL in `PHANTOM_AUDIT_URL`,
authenticating with `MCP_TOKEN`.

# Why fire-and-forget

Audit writes shouldn't block tool execution. If the agent is briefly
unreachable (rolling restart, network blip), the connector's main
job — answering the tool call — should still succeed. The forwarder
buffers up to N events in memory and retries with exponential
backoff in a background task; events that exhaust retries are
logged at WARN level (visible via `docker logs phantom-connector-X`)
and dropped.

# Why not write directly to audit_log.db

Two reasons:
  1. Single source of truth. The agent's audit_log is the operator-
     facing record; having connectors write directly to the same
     SQLite file would require write coordination across containers,
     which SQLite handles poorly under contention.
  2. Defense-in-depth. A compromised connector that can write
     arbitrary rows to audit_log.db could inject false trail entries.
     Forcing it through the agent's HTTP endpoint means the agent
     can validate, rate-limit, and (future) sign rows before they
     land in durable storage.

# Phase 1 simplification

This implementation uses a tiny in-memory queue + asyncio task. It's
not durable across container restarts. Events emitted in the brief
window between "tool finished" and "container received SIGTERM"
might be lost.

That's acceptable for v0.1.30 because:
  - Most audit-worthy tool outcomes are also visible in the agent's
    direct chat-turn audit (chat_turn_cost, agent_self_mod_executed)
    which never leaves the agent process.
  - The connector-side audit is "nice to have" (per-call diagnostic
    rows), not "load-bearing" (security/compliance attestation).
  - Phase 2/3 can add a small WAL-backed buffer if the loss rate
    proves real in production.
