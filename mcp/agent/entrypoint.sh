# Lifecycle:
#   1. Bootstrap skills (if /app/skills is empty/new)
#   2. Generate MCP_TOKEN if not provided (internal coordination only)
#   3. Start the MCP in the background, wait for /ping/ to return 200

#   5. If either child exits unexpectedly, kill the other and exit
#      with the dead child's exit code (so docker-compose's restart

# ─── 1. Skills bootstrap ────────────────────────────────────────
#
# v0.3.2+ — per-release marker-driven merge.
#
# Stamps `${SKILLS_DIR}/.seeded_version` with PHANTOM_VERSION on every
# successful seed/merge. Subsequent boots compare the marker against
# the running release; if they differ, the new release's image-baked
# defaults get merged into the volume (cp -r — overwrites same-named
# files but does NOT delete files only present in the volume, so
# operator-created skills are preserved). If the marker matches,
# the bootstrap is a no-op — operator deletions of default skills
# stick across same-version restarts.
#
# Three trigger paths:
#   FORCE_SKILLS_SYNC=1         operator override (always merges)
#   marker missing or stale     per-release auto-merge (the common
#                               case for upgrade installs — no docker
#                               exec workaround needed)
#   volume empty                fresh-install seed
#
# Pre-v0.3.2 the entrypoint had only the "volume empty" branch, which
# meant new image-default skills never propagated to existing
# customer installs without manual `docker exec cp -r ...`. The
# marker-driven flow makes per-release skill rollouts automatic.
#
# Operator deletions across releases:
#   Delete a default skill on v0.3.2 + restart same release → marker
#   matches → no merge → deletion sticks. Upgrade to v0.3.3 → marker
#   stale → merge fires → deleted-but-still-in-image skill comes back.
#   That's the right semantic: upgrading to a new release is opting
#   into its default set. To permanently retire a default, modify the
#   image's skills-default directory or use the bundle's denylist
#   surface (planned).

# page entirely and does not write .env.generated anywhere. Operator
# settings live in their canonical stores (SecretStore for credentials,
# settings_store for non-secret config); entrypoint reads bundle-internal
# coordination directly from container env above.

# ─── 2.2. TLS-by-default auto-generation ───────────────────────
# Requirement: the stack MUST always have a TLS cert available. This
# covers two scenarios:
#   1. Fresh install: setup page needs HTTPS (chicken-and-egg —
#      operator picks TLS mode through the page, page must already
#      be TLS).
#   2. Upgrade: an install created before TLS-by-default carries a
#      setup.json with no cert; auto-gen on next boot brings it up
#      to spec without operator intervention.
#
# Mechanism: 2048-bit self-signed cert written to /tls/cert.pem +
# /tls/key.pem on the shared phantom_tls volume. xlog and caldera
# read those same files (ro mount) at startup; the agent reads them
# via SSL_CERT_FILE/SSL_KEY_FILE.
#
# When the operator picks "custom" TLS in the setup form, /api/setup
# overwrites /tls/{cert,key}.pem with their PEM. When they pick
# "self-signed", /api/setup keeps the auto-generated material. Either
# way /tls/ is populated, so this entrypoint reuses it on next boot.

# /tls/key.pem, xlog (ro mount) reads them at startup and serves
# HTTPS; same for caldera. The agent itself reads them via SSL_CERT_FILE
# below.
#
# Auto-gen runs whenever /tls/ doesn't already have a valid cert + key
# pair. setup.json's existence is intentionally NOT part of the gate:
# TLS-by-default means a cert is always available, irrespective of
# whether the operator has ever opened the setup form. This also fixes
# the upgrade path — installs created before the TLS-by-default change
# carry a legacy setup.json with no cert; on next boot the agent
# generates one and the whole stack moves to HTTPS without operator
# intervention.
#
# Operator opt-out doesn't exist any more: the setup form has no
# "HTTP only" option, and the API route at /api/setup either reuses
# the auto-cert (self-signed mode) or writes the operator's PEM
# (custom mode). Either way /tls/cert.pem is populated.

# ─── 2.5. Seed admin auth defaults (idempotent) ─────────────────
#
# v0.4.0 — boot-time seeding of /ui/auth/admin/password_hash in the
# SecretStore. v0.5.5 — the default password moved out of the image
# into PHANTOM_DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD (sourced from .env). No credential
# is baked anywhere in any Phantom image as of v0.5.5.
#
# Behavior:
#   - If SecretStore already holds a password hash for the `admin`
#     user, this is a no-op (returns "already_initialized"). The
#     env var is NOT consulted on already-initialized stores —
#     upgrades from pre-v0.5.5 installs that don't carry the env
#     var still work.
#   - If no hash exists (fresh volume), seeds the PBKDF2 hash of
#     $PHANTOM_DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD, and sets the
#     `credentials_changed=false` flag so the UI shows the "change
#     default password" banner on first login.
#   - If no hash exists AND $PHANTOM_DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD is unset
#     or empty, the Python seed call raises — the agent refuses to
#     boot with an empty admin credential. Fail-loud per the v0.4.0
#     canonical-state discipline; operator must re-run the installer
#     (which auto-generates the value into .env) or set the env var
#     manually and restart.
#
# Failure mode: if SecretStore can't be initialized (KEK missing,
# data volume read-only, etc.), this command EXITS the container.
# We fail loud rather than fall back to insecure defaults — pre-v0.4.0
# the silent env-plaintext fallback was the root of multiple
# regressions (v0.3.20 KEK mismatch, v0.3.27 SA-empty). Loud failure
# tells the operator exactly what to fix.

# When SSL is NOT configured, Next.js binds port 3000 directly as before.
