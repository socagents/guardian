/**
 * POST /api/auth/logout  (v0.4.0)
 *
 * Revokes the session server-side AND clears the cookie. Idempotent:
 * if no cookie is present (or it's already revoked), the response is
 * still 200 — the operator's intent ("end this session") is satisfied
 * either way.
 *
 * Server-side revocation is the important half: clearing the cookie
 * alone wouldn't stop an attacker who already grabbed it. By calling
 * the MCP's /api/v1/ui/auth/logout, we hash the token and mark its
 * row in auth_sessions.db as revoked. Any subsequent validateSession()
 * call for that token returns invalid.
