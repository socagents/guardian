/**
 * R2 v0.11.0 — category-to-badge mapping.
 *
 * Raw category names come from Cortex pack_metadata.json (verbose taxonomy
 * mirroring the upstream content marketplace). The UI surfaces a short
 * 1-2 word badge so the operator can read a vendor card at a glance.
 *
 * Edit policy: this map is the SINGLE source of truth for which badges
 * exist. Adding a new badge starts here. Categories not in this map
 * fall through to a "Other" badge so untaxed packs still show something.
 *
 * Ordering matters for the OUTER vendor card: when a vendor groups N packs
 * with M distinct categories between them, we dedupe and show up to 4
 * badges in BADGE_PRIORITY_ORDER. SIEM-first because that's the dominant
 * use case in the Phantom catalog (81 of 197 packs).
