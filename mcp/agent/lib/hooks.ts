/**
 * Hook framework — Round-15 / Phase H.
 *
 * Lifecycle policy hooks for the chat handler. Adapted from SnowAgent's
 * `coreTypes.ts:HOOK_EVENTS` (`/Users/ayman/Documents/Coding/guardian/
 * snow-agent-complete/snow-agent/10-hooks/coreTypes.ts`), filtered to
 * the events Guardian's chat-route actually fires today.
 *
 * Why hooks (vs. modifying tools):
 *
 * Enterprise SOC ops need policy that doesn't fit inside any one tool:
 *
 *   - "Block any xsiam_create_dataset against production tenants
 *      until #soc-ops approves" — needs PreToolUse + external comms.
 *   - "Inject the active incident's ticket id into every chat as
 *      context" — needs UserPromptSubmit.
 *   - "Notify the on-call when a tool call fails (rt.tool.failed)"
 *      — needs PostToolUse.
 *   - "Don't run /compress between 9-5 in tenant-X session" — needs
 *      PreCompact.
 *
 * Hard-coding any of those into a tool means every tool needs its own
 * policy plumbing, or we end up with 12 if-branches inside the chat-
 * route. Hooks decouple the policy from the tool: registration is
 * data, not code.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *
 *   - `HOOK_EVENTS` — closed list of fire-sites. Adding an event
 *     requires (a) appending here, (b) adding a `runHooks(event=...)`
 *     call at the corresponding chat-route point. Hooks against an
 *     unknown event name are stored but never fire.
 *   - `Hook` — a registered hook entry. Carries identity + matcher
 *     + transport + behavior config.
 *   - `HookContext` — what the dispatcher passes to each hook on
 *     fire. Per-event shape is documented inline; hooks receive a
 *     JSON payload, return a JSON `HookResult`.
 *   - `HookResult.decision` lets a hook **deny / allow / ask** for
 *     PreToolUse + PermissionRequest events; for other events the
 *     decision is informational ("succeed / fail").
 *   - Four transports: `command` (subprocess), `http` (POST to a
 *     webhook), `agent` (a tool the model can invoke — implemented
 *     in Phase X via plugins), and `builtin` (v0.5.21 / Issue #26 —
 *     an in-process TypeScript handler shipped with the agent image,
 *     selected from `/settings/hooks` by name from the registry in
 *     `lib/hook-builtins/`). `command` and `http` cover bring-your-
 *     own integrations; `builtin` covers framework-side primitives
 *     (slack approval, rate-limit, memory-inject) that don't justify
 *     the subprocess / HTTP round-trip cost.
 *   - Failure policy per hook: `block` (treat hook error as deny),
 *     `allow` (treat hook error as no-op), `warn` (log + allow).
 *
 * Dispatcher: see `lib/hook-runner.ts`.
