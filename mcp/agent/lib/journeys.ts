/**
 * Phantom user journeys — operator-facing walkthroughs.
 *
 * Modeled after spark_ui/lib/testing/journeys.ts (1,800 LoC of typed
 * journey definitions rendered as an in-app help/testing surface). Two
 * differences from the spark pattern, deliberately:
 *
 *   1. Phantom is a chat-first agent. spark_ui's journeys are
 *      page-by-page click paths; phantom's primary surface is the chat
 *      itself, so each journey carries a `prompts` array (the literal
 *      text to paste into the chat) AND an `apis` array (for scripted
 *      / curl-driven equivalents).
 *
 *   2. Phantom journeys carry `toolsExercised` — the MCP tool names the
 *      agent SHOULD invoke when the prompt is correct. This is the
 *      assertion shape: an operator can run the prompt, watch the audit
 *      log via `/observability/events`, and verify the same tool names
 *      fired. Same role spark's `apis` plays for HTTP-driven flows.
 *
 * Each journey is a small reproducible test of one user-visible
 * capability. Adding a new journey here surfaces it on /help; no other
 * registration step. Treat the file as a living test catalog — when a
 * new feature ships, add a journey before merging.
