/**
 * Builtin hook spec contract — Issue #26 (v0.5.21).
 *
 * A "builtin" hook is an in-process TypeScript function shipped in the
 * phantom-agent image (under `mcp/agent/lib/hook-builtins/`) that operators
 * can install from `/settings/hooks` with a single dropdown pick + a
 * dynamic config form — no subprocess, no HTTP, no code edits.
 *
 * Why a registry vs. one-off handlers:
 *
 *   - **Operator-facing affordance** — `/settings/hooks` needs to enumerate
 *     "what builtins exist" + render each one's config form. A registry is
 *     the natural place to ask both questions.
 *   - **Validation** — the same registry that lists builtins to the UI
 *     also lets `validateHook()` confirm that a stored hook's
 *     `transport.name` references a known builtin AND that its `config`
 *     matches the builtin's expected shape.
 *   - **Dispatch** — the hook-runner asks the registry "give me the
 *     handler for builtin `X`", invokes it with the payload + config.
 *
 * Why not zod / json-schema:
 *
 *   - The agent has no zod / ajv dependency today (`mcp/agent/package.json`
 *     has zero schema-validation packages). Adding one for this issue is
 *     scope creep — the existing `validateHook()` in `lib/hooks.ts` uses
 *     plain typed-validator functions, and the builtin specs follow the
 *     same pattern: each spec exports a `validateConfig(unknown) -> Result`
 *     function it owns end-to-end.
 *
 * Why builtins ship in `phantom-agent`'s image (not as plugins):
 *
 *   - Builtins are framework-side primitives (slack-approval, rate-limit,
 *     context-warning, memory-inject). They're the same surface for every
 *     deployment; shipping them in-image guarantees they're available
 *     out-of-the-box, no install step.
 *   - Issue #29 (entry-point plugins) is the path for THIRD-PARTY
 *     extensions that ship in customer-installed packages. Builtins are
 *     our path; plugins are theirs. Both coexist.
