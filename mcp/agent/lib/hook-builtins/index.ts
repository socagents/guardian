/**
 * Builtin hook registry — Issue #26 (v0.5.21).
 *
 * Single source of truth for which builtin handlers ship with this
 * guardian-agent image. Lookup is by `name` (the value of
 * `transport.name` on a registered builtin-transport hook).
 *
 * Why a const Record vs. dynamic import / discovery:
 *
 *   - The set of builtins is small and ships with the image. Listing
 *     them statically here means `npx tsc --noEmit` catches at build
 *     time any spec that doesn't satisfy `BuiltinHookSpec` — a runtime
 *     "import everything in the directory" path would defer those
 *     errors to first-fire.
 *   - The agent UI fetches the registry over `/api/agent/hooks/builtins`
 *     (Issue #26 endpoint) to populate the dropdown. A static export
 *     gives the route handler a synchronous, no-IO read of the catalog.
 *
 * Adding a new builtin:
 *   1. Create `lib/hook-builtins/<name>.ts` exporting a `BuiltinHookSpec`.
 *   2. Import + add to `BUILTIN_HOOKS` below.
 *   3. Verify `tsc --noEmit` is clean.
 *
 * Issues that will add to this registry:
 *   - #25 — memory-inject-session-start / -instance-focus / -job-run
 *   - #27 — pre-compact-context-warning
 *   - #31 — cost-ledger, cost-warn-over-budget
