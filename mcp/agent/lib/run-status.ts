/**
 * RunStatusReason — Round-15 / Phase Y.
 *
 * Adapted from SnowAgent's terminal/continue reasons (snow-agent-
 * complete/snow-agent/04-query-engine/) — every chat turn has an
 * answer to "why did this stop or pause." Surfacing the reason on
 * the SSE done event AND the persisted assistant message gives
 * operators diagnostics they didn't have before.
 *
 * Today's chat-route ends turns silently in many cases:
 *   - max_output_tokens hit → assistant cuts off mid-sentence
 *   - max_turns hit → tool loop exits without explanation
 *   - hook denied → run aborts with an error event
 *   - context overflow → caught at provider, surfaces as a generic
 *     error
 *
 * With RunStatusReason set on every done event, the chat UI can
 * surface a small footer chip ("stopped: max_output_tokens") and
 * /observability/events queries can group session-ends by reason
 * to find systematic issues.
