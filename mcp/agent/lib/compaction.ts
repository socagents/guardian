/**
 * Conversation compaction — operator-triggered summarization.
 *
 * Round-13 / Phase 4.5. The operator wanted a `/compress` slash
 * command in chat to manually flush long conversation history into a
 * compact summary, freeing up context budget for new turns. Phase 5
 * will wire automatic compaction (triggered when the budget walk
 * decides we'd overflow); this module is the shared helper both will
 * call.
 *
 * Design:
 *
 *   1. Take the prior persisted messages (from
 *      `/api/v1/sessions/{id}/messages`) and a `summarize` callback
 *      that knows how to invoke an LLM. Caller supplies the LLM —
 *      this module is provider-agnostic.
 *   2. Build a summarization prompt that asks the model to preserve:
 *        - Open tasks and current status
 *        - Decisions made
 *        - Opaque IDs verbatim (UUIDs, operation IDs, audit-row
 *          ids — anything the next turn might need to reference).
 *      OpenClaw's `IDENTIFIER_PRESERVATION_INSTRUCTIONS` was the
 *      reference here.
 *   3. Return the summary text + a checkpoint marker that
 *      `loadSessionHistory` can recognize.
 *
 * The checkpoint shape:
 *
 *      role: 'system'
 *      content: '<summary text>'
 *      meta: { kind: 'compaction-checkpoint', covers_until: <iso ts> }
 *
 * loadSessionHistory looks for the latest message with
 * `meta.kind === 'compaction-checkpoint'` and treats everything
 * BEFORE it as already-summarized. Only the checkpoint itself + every
 * message AFTER it ends up in the Gemini contents array. So the
 * operator can run /compress whenever — older turns roll into the
 * checkpoint and stop consuming budget.
 *
 * Why an explicit checkpoint marker instead of replacing-then-
 * deleting: persistence stays append-only (audit-friendly), the
 * original transcript is still recoverable for export, and multiple
 * compactions can stack (each new checkpoint supersedes prior ones
 * without a destructive write).

Produce a SINGLE compact summary covering:

  1. **Active tasks and their current status** — anything the operator
     is in the middle of doing, what's done, what's blocked, what
     needs review.
  2. **Decisions made** — choices the operator endorsed (vendor X for
     firewall, schedule Y for the daily job). The next turn must read
     these as already-decided, not re-litigated.
  3. **Tool round-trips and their outcomes** — which tools were
     invoked, what arguments, what results. Operators routinely
     reference earlier tool outputs ("show me the result of that port
     scan again"); the summary must preserve enough detail that the
     model can answer.
  4. **Opaque identifiers VERBATIM**: UUIDs, operation IDs, session
     IDs, rule IDs, IP addresses, hostnames, audit-row ids,
     timestamps, vendor:product strings. Never paraphrase or
     summarize these — copy them exactly. The operator and the next
     turn will use them as keys to look things up.

Format: concise paragraphs. No headers, no bullet lists, no markdown
formatting. Just dense prose. Aim for ~300-500 words regardless of
input length.

Do NOT:
  - Add commentary ("the operator seems frustrated", "this was
    interesting"). Stick to facts.
  - Speculate about future actions.
  - Drop verbatim IDs. If you summarize a UUID, you've broken the
    contract.`;
