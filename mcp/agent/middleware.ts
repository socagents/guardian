/**
 * Next.js middleware — server-side session-cookie enforcement for all
 * agent-control surfaces.
 *
 * v0.9.1 — closes the gap behind issue #70 (*"API auth gate is client-side
 * only; /api/agent/* mutations callable without auth headers"*).
 *
 * # Threat model
 *
 * Pre-v0.9.1, AuthGate (`components/auth/auth-gate.tsx`) decided what the
 * BROWSER rendered but imposed zero protection on the server-side API. Any
 * caller that reached port 3000 — by VM lateral movement, misconfigured
 * firewall, accidentally-exposed cloud LB, container escape — could POST
 * `/api/agent/memory`, `/api/agent/jobs`, `/api/chat`, `/api/skills`, etc.
 * with NO cookies and get 200/201 back. The deployment relied on the
 * network boundary (IAP tunnel) as the only auth gate. Defense-in-shallow.
 *
 * v0.9.1 adds a session-cookie check at the SERVER tier. Same `guardian_session`
 * cookie AuthGate reads on the client; same `validateSession` call the
 * `/api/auth/status` route makes. The cookie's value must validate against
 * the MCP-side session store; absence OR invalid value → 401 JSON.
 *
 * # Coverage
 *
 * The matcher (see `config.matcher` below) targets every server endpoint that
 * exposes the agent or its data:
 *
 *   /api/agent/**   — 84 routes including memory, jobs, hooks, sessions,
 *                     skills CRUD, tool dispatch, secrets-adjacent metadata
 *   /api/chat       — kicks off a full LLM turn with real tool calls
 *   /api/skills/**  — skill CRUD outside the /api/agent/ prefix
 *
 * `/api/auth/*` is INTENTIONALLY excluded — login can't require login, and
 * AuthGate polls `/api/auth/status` BEFORE any cookie exists.
 *
 * `/api/marketplace/connectors` and `/api/marketplace/connectors/[id]` are
 * ALSO intentionally excluded (silently — they're outside the `/api/agent/`
 * prefix). They serve hardcoded read-only connector catalog JSON: no
 * secrets, no mutation surface, no credential access. Leaving them open
 * lets pre-login pages render the marketplace card list. **If these routes
 * ever grow write handlers, extend the matcher to cover them in the same
 * PR** — the silent exclusion becomes dangerous the moment they mutate.
 *
 * # Exemptions (paths the matcher hits but cookie-check skips)
 *
 *   /api/agent/health           — Docker compose healthcheck calls this
 *                                  from inside the container with no cookies.
 *                                  Gating it makes the container unhealthy.
 *
 *   /api/agent/internal/fire-hook — Called by the embedded MCP subprocess,
 *                                  uses `MCP_TOKEN` bearer (not the session
 *                                  cookie). Has its own auth layer. Gating
 *                                  it with a session check would break hook
 *                                  dispatch.
 *
 * # Edge runtime
 *
 * Next.js 15.1.6 — middleware runs on the Edge runtime (Node.js runtime is
 * GA in 15.2+). `validateSession` uses only `fetch` + in-memory cache, so it
 * works in Edge. `mcpPost` resolves the MCP URL from runtime-config, which
 * also only uses fetch.
 *
 * # Performance
 *
 * `validateSession` has a 30-second positive cache (in-memory Map inside
 * `lib/auth-store.ts`). First request per cookie: one fetch to the embedded
 * MCP's `/api/v1/ui/auth/session` (~10ms loopback). Cached requests: 0 ms.
 * Negative results NOT cached (revocation must surface immediately).
