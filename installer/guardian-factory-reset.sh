# Guardian factory reset (v0.5.3+)
#
# Host-side utility. Wipes all operator-state volumes for the Guardian
# stack and re-runs the installer so the customer returns to the
# fresh-shipped state.
#
# Usage:
#
#   sudo /opt/guardian/guardian-factory-reset
#   sudo /opt/guardian/guardian-factory-reset --yes   # skip confirmation
#   sudo /opt/guardian/guardian-factory-reset --dry-run
#
# # Why this script exists separately from the installer
#
# CLAUDE.md's "Volume management — NEVER in the installer" rule:
# the installer cares about image deployment, this script cares
# about state. Cramming both into one tool conflates two
# responsibilities and produces the kind of `--reset-volumes` flag
# that operators run by accident and then file as a support ticket.
# Separation makes both halves easier to reason about.
#
# # Why this script is host-side (not inside the container)
#
# A container cannot delete the docker volume it has mounted — the
# daemon refuses with a "volume in use" error. Factory reset MUST
# operate from outside the container boundary by definition.
#
# # What this script does
#
#   1. Pre-flight: confirm we're at /opt/guardian and a stack exists.
#   2. List volumes that match the guardian_* naming convention.
#   3. Ask for confirmation (typed "FACTORY RESET" or --yes flag).
#   4. docker compose down --remove-orphans (stops + removes containers).
#   5. docker volume rm <each matching volume> (wipes state).
#   6. Re-run the installer (guardian-installer or guardian-installer-dev)
#      to recreate volumes + bring fresh containers up.
#   7. Report what was wiped + how many seconds the whole thing took.
#
# # What this script does NOT do
#
#   - Touch the .env (preserves GUARDIAN_SECRET_KEK + registry creds +
#     other operator-managed settings). To rotate those, edit .env
#     by hand BEFORE running factory reset.
#   - Delete the install kit itself or this script. If you want to
#     start over from a fresh tarball, `rm -rf /opt/guardian` and
#     re-extract the kit.
#   - Mutate any images on disk. The next install will pull whichever
#     digests the installer has pinned (latest customer release or
#     :dev for the dev installer).
