# Builds the customer-facing single-file installer.
#
# Combines:
#   installer/phantom-installer.template.sh   (the script body)
#   installer/docker-compose.yml              (the compose YAML)
#   (reset-ui-password.sh retired in v0.4.0 — see notes below)
#   ${MANIFEST_PATH}                          (digest manifest, v0.3.0+)
# into a single executable `phantom-installer` file by substituting
# four markers in the template:
#
#   __INSTALLER_COMPOSE_YAML__         ← replaced with the compose YAML
#   __INSTALLER_VERSION__              ← replaced with the literal version
#   (the __INSTALLER_RESET_PASSWORD_SH__ marker was retired in v0.4.0
#    along with the recovery script — see notes below)
#   __INSTALLER_DIGEST_MANIFEST__      ← replaced with the digest manifest
#                                        (v0.3.0+; tag-based fallback when absent)
#
# Usage:
#   VERSION=0.3.0 MANIFEST_PATH=/path/to/release-manifest-v0.3.0.env \
#     ./installer/build-phantom-installer.sh
#
# When MANIFEST_PATH is not set (e.g. local dev builds without a full
# release pipeline), an empty placeholder manifest is embedded — the
# installer detects this at runtime and prints a clear error. Customer
# release builds via release.yml ALWAYS pass MANIFEST_PATH.
#
# Why a Python one-liner for the substitution: sed and awk both have
# special-character handling problems with multi-kilobyte payloads
# that contain shell metacharacters. Python's str.replace is bulletproof.

# just gives operators a clean invocation shape consistent with the
