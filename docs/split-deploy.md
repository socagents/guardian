# Phantom — Split-Deploy Guide

> **Audience:** the operator who received a slim Phantom agent
> bundle (`phantom-agent-bundle-agent-only.tar.gz`) and wants to
> run the agent on a machine that is **separate** from where xlog
> and caldera run.

This is the right deployment shape when:

- You want one Phantom agent installation that talks to a **shared**
  xlog/caldera deployment another team operates.
- You want to keep the agent on a small, low-privilege host while
  xlog/caldera live on a beefier red-team box.
- You want the agent and the simulation backends to scale, deploy,
  and rotate credentials independently.

If xlog and caldera are running on the same machine as the agent,
use the all-in-one compose recipe (`docker-compose.yml`) instead;
this guide doesn't apply.

## Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐                ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ Machine A — Phantom agent        │  HTTP/HTTPS    │ Machine B — SOC services         │

└──────────────────────────────────┘                └──────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Machine A** runs only the `phantom-agent` container. The container
ships both the Next.js UI and the embedded MCP server (per the
spark-agents v1.2 bundle design — the MCP is part of the agent's
trust boundary, not a sibling service).

**Machine B** runs xlog and caldera. They expose their HTTP ports
to Machine A's network so the agent can reach them.

**XSIAM** is external and reached over the public internet.

operator-supplied (URLs, credentials, settings) flows in via the
setup form at first run — no environment variables to set, no
config files to edit, no secrets in CI.

## Network requirements

### On Machine A (the agent)
- Outbound HTTP/HTTPS to Machine B's xlog port (default 8000) and
  caldera port (default 8888 / 8443).
- Outbound HTTPS to your XSIAM tenant API + webhook endpoint.
- Outbound HTTPS to `aiplatform.googleapis.com` /
  `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` for Gemini / Vertex AI.
- Inbound port 3000 from your operators' browsers.
- (Optional) Inbound port 8080 from any external SOC tool that
  wants to call MCP admin endpoints. If nothing external needs
  MCP access, drop the port mapping for tighter security.

### On Machine B (xlog + caldera)
- xlog must bind to an interface reachable from Machine A.
  Update Machine B's docker-compose to expose `8000` to its host
  network and ensure firewall allows Machine A's IP through:
  ```yaml
  xlog:
    ports:
      - "0.0.0.0:8000:8000"     # bind to all interfaces
  ```
- caldera same:
  ```yaml
  caldera:
    ports:
      - "0.0.0.0:8888:8888"
      - "0.0.0.0:8443:8443"
  ```
- DNS: either give Machine B a hostname Machine A can resolve, or
  use Machine B's IP directly in the setup form.

### Production hardening
- Terminate TLS in front of xlog and caldera (a reverse proxy on
  Machine B with a real certificate, or use the bundled
  `SSL_CERT_PEM` / `SSL_KEY_PEM` for caldera's built-in HTTPS on
  :8443).
- Restrict Machine A's MCP port (8080) to localhost-only or behind
  a VPN — operators rarely need direct MCP admin access.

## First-run flow

```bash
# 1. Extract the archive
tar -xzf phantom-agent-bundle-agent-only.tar.gz
cd phantom-agent-bundle-agent-only

# 2. Verify checksums (recommended)
shasum -a 256 -c checksums.sha256

# 3. Load the agent image
docker load < images/phantom-agent-local.tar

# 4. Generate operator-supplied secrets:
#      MCP_TOKEN          — bundle-internal bearer (pin so it stays
#                           stable across restarts).
#      PHANTOM_SECRET_KEK — 32-byte AES-256-GCM key encrypting all
#                           operator-supplied secrets at rest.
#                           Without this, the secrets directory
#                           (Caldera creds, XSIAM auth, Vertex SA)
#                           is plaintext on disk and in the backup
#                           tarball.
{
  echo "MCP_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
  echo "PHANTOM_SECRET_KEK=$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
} > .env
chmod 600 .env

# 5. Bring up the agent
docker compose up -d

# 6. Wait for healthy
until [ "$(docker inspect -f '{{.State.Health.Status}}' phantom_agent 2>/dev/null)" = "healthy" ]; do
  sleep 3
done
echo "agent ready"

# 7. Open the setup page
echo "→ Open http://$(hostname):3000 in your browser"
```

The setup page presents one form section per connector + provider +
required setting. Fill in:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **UI password** | A strong password you'll use to log in to the agent |
| **Gemini API key** _OR_ **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS** | Either an API key from Google AI Studio, or your service-account JSON content (one of, not both) |
| **calderaBaseUrl** | `http://<machine-b>:8888` — Caldera's HTTP API on the remote host |
| **calderaApiKey** | The red-team API key (must match what was baked into Caldera at its first boot) |
| **calderaRedUser** / **calderaRedPassword** | Caldera red-team operator credentials |
| **xlogBaseUrl** | `http://<machine-b>:8000` — xlog's GraphQL API |
| **xsiamPapiUrl** | Your XSIAM tenant's PAPI URL |
| **xsiamPapiAuthHeader** / **xsiamPapiAuthId** | XSIAM PAPI bearer credentials |
| **xsiamPlaygroundId** | Your XSIAM playground / war-room ID |
| **xsiamWebhookEndpoint** / **xsiamWebhookKey** | XSIAM HTTP collector for synthetic logs |
| **vertexProjectId** / **vertexRegion** / **vertexServiceAccountJson** | If using Vertex AI for Gemini, the GCP project + region + service-account JSON content |

Click **Save**. Phantom materializes one connector instance per
binding (Phase 5 SecretStore-backed), reloads its tool registry,
and routes you to the home page.

You're done. The agent's tools (xlog scenarios, caldera operations,
XSIAM detection validation) are now wired against your remote
infrastructure.

---

## Verify the deploy

```bash
# Smoke test the full Phase 5-11a capability surface against your
# new deployment. Reads MCP_TOKEN from inside the running container.
# (The script is hoisted to top-level scripts/ in the slim bundle —
# the bundles/spark/mcp/scripts/ path used by the full bundle is
# baked into the image but not present on the slim host.)
MCP_TOKEN=$(docker compose exec -T phantom-agent printenv MCP_TOKEN) \
  scripts/smoke_test.sh
```

Expected: **31/31 PASS**, with no skips. If any check fails, the
script reports which capability and why.

You can also test connectivity from the agent to Machine B directly:

```bash
docker compose exec -T phantom-agent curl -sf http://<machine-b>:8000/health
docker compose exec -T phantom-agent curl -sf http://<machine-b>:8888/
```

If either curl hangs or fails, the issue is between Machine A and
Machine B — verify the firewall, the port binding (`0.0.0.0:`
prefix), and the DNS / IP you used in the setup form.

---

## Updating credentials later

Operator-supplied values live in `/app/data/secrets/` (the Phase-5
SecretStore inside the persistent `phantom_mcp_data` volume) and
`/app/runtime/setup.json` (in the bind-mounted `.phantom-agent/`
directory). To rotate:

- **Caldera credentials** — visit `/setup` again in the browser
  and resubmit. The instance store updates atomically; old
  credentials are deleted.
- **XSIAM credentials** — same.
- **Vertex / Gemini API keys** — same.

The audit log (`/api/v1/audit`) records every credential rotation
with the operator who initiated it.

---

## Backup and recovery

The two volumes that hold operator state:

| Volume | Contents |
|---|---|
| `phantom_mcp_data` | Sqlite stores: audit log, instance store, secret paths, KB, sessions, memory, jobs |
| `phantom_mcp_skills` | Skills library (markdown), seeded from image at first run |

The bind-mounted `./.phantom-agent/` directory holds the setup
form's submitted values and a generated `.env` snapshot.

**Backup** (use the script — it captures BOTH volumes plus the
`./.phantom-agent/` bind-mount, hashes each component, and writes
a manifest so the restore side can refuse a corrupted archive):
```bash
scripts/backup_phantom.sh --label pre-upgrade
# → ./phantom-backup-pre-upgrade-20260429T120000Z.tar.gz
```

**Restore on a new machine:**
```bash
# 1. Bring up the agent compose just to materialize empty volumes
docker compose up -d
docker compose down                       # leaves the volumes empty

# 2. Restore from your backup archive
scripts/restore_phantom.sh phantom-backup-pre-upgrade-20260429T120000Z.tar.gz

# 3. Bring the agent back up — your audit log, KB, instance configs,
#    and operator setup values are all in place.
docker compose up -d
```

The restore script refuses to overwrite non-empty volumes by default
(safety against silent clobber). Pass `--force` to opt in.

**What's NOT in the backup**: the Docker image itself (carry that via
the agent bundle archive), and any state inside xlog/caldera on
Machine B (those have their own backup story — out of scope for this
guide).

**KEK warning**: when `PHANTOM_SECRET_KEK` is set in `.env`, the
backup tarball contains AES-256-GCM ciphertext for every operator-
supplied secret. The KEK itself is NOT in the tarball (it's in
`.env` which `backup_phantom.sh` does not capture by design — env
files often hold per-deploy values like network addresses you don't
want restored verbatim). **Store the KEK separately in your secret
manager.** Losing it means losing every secret in the backup; you'd
have to re-fill the setup form on the restored machine.

The trade-off is intentional: a stolen backup tarball is useless
without the KEK, which is the core security property
encryption-at-rest gives you.

---

## Encryption-at-rest for operator secrets

By default, every operator-supplied secret (Caldera API key, XSIAM
PAPI auth, Vertex service-account JSON, etc.) is encrypted with
AES-256-GCM before touching disk. The encryption key (KEK) lives in
`.env` as `PHANTOM_SECRET_KEK`.

Without `PHANTOM_SECRET_KEK` set, the SecretStore falls back to
plaintext mode for upgrade compatibility. You'll see a startup
warning:

```
SecretStore: PHANTOM_SECRET_KEK is NOT set — secrets stored as
PLAINTEXT on disk.
```

To enable encryption on an existing deploy:

```bash
# 1. Generate a KEK and add to .env (back it up to your secret
#    manager FIRST — losing it loses every secret).
echo "PHANTOM_SECRET_KEK=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env

# 2. Restart the agent. Existing plaintext files migrate to encrypted
#    automatically on next read of each secret.
docker compose restart phantom-agent
```

Migration is transparent and per-secret: the first read after restart
detects a plaintext file, decodes it, re-writes it as encrypted,
returns the value. Subsequent reads see the encrypted form. No
operator action beyond setting the env var.

**Do NOT remove `PHANTOM_SECRET_KEK` once set on a deploy with
encrypted secrets.** The agent will refuse to read encrypted files
without the KEK rather than return garbage. To go back to plaintext
mode, you'd need to read every secret out (with the KEK), unset the
env var, and re-fill the setup form.

## Troubleshooting

### Container marks itself unhealthy after start
- Check `docker compose logs phantom-agent` for the `[entrypoint]`
  lines. Both processes (MCP + Next.js) should report ready.
- The combined-container healthcheck verifies both ports 3000 and
  8080 are responding. If one is down, the container is unhealthy.

### Setup page shows "MCP not configured"
- The Phase-5 SecretStore needs writable volume mounts. Verify
  `phantom_mcp_data` and `./.phantom-agent` are mounted (check
  `docker inspect phantom_agent`).

### Tool calls timeout or 502
- Indicates Machine A → Machine B network failure. From inside
  the agent container:
  ```bash
  docker compose exec -T phantom-agent curl -v http://<machine-b>:8000/health
  ```
  If this fails, fix the network on Machine B before troubleshooting
  the agent further.

### Agent UI loads but `/api/auth/status` 503s
- Indicates the embedded MCP didn't start. Check `docker compose
  logs phantom-agent | grep ERROR` — typically a Python import
  error in the bundle's connector source. The image was likely
  built against a different bundle version than what's currently
  in `/app/bundle`. Rebuild or pull a fresh image.

---

## When to switch to the all-in-one bundle

The all-in-one bundle (`phantom-agent-bundle-full.tar.gz`)
includes xlog and caldera images alongside the agent. Use it when:

- You're a single operator running the whole stack on one host.
- You're doing a demo / proof-of-concept and don't want to set up
  cross-host networking.
- You're standing up a fresh environment where you want xlog and
  caldera to be installed alongside the agent on the same machine.

Switching from split to all-in-one is non-destructive — the
`phantom_mcp_data` volume holding your audit log, KB, sessions,
and instance configs is portable. Just `docker compose down` (no
`-v`) on the slim deploy, copy the volume to the new host, and
`docker compose up -d` with the full compose file.
