"""v0.17.90 — content audit + enrichment for the 22 validated vendor YAMLs.

Targets the exact 22 directories from the v0.17.79 autonomous-smoke arc
(scripts/maintainer/e2e_all_vendors_via_agent_mcp.py's VENDORS list).

For each YAML this script:

  1. **Replaces the description** with a richer, vendor-context-aware
     paragraph (2-3 sentences covering what the vendor IS, what its CEF
     logs typically contain, and the operator's simulation utility).
     Pre-v0.17.90 descriptions were 1-line summaries (often pulled from
     the vendor's brief marketing tagline). Operator-surfaced as too brief.

  2. **Improves field examples** based on type + name heuristics:

     - `example: "see message"` → realistic free-form text
     - `example: '{}'` (json type) → realistic JSON shape per field name
     - `example: 'sample_<prefix>'` → realistic-typed value
     - leaves already-good examples untouched (numeric, URL, IP, etc.)

  3. **Adds `validated: true`** at the top level (above pack_name) so
     v0.17.91 can render a small green "Validated" pill on the Browse
     page row for vendors we've tested end-to-end.

  4. **Preserves `how_to_use`** verbatim — v0.17.79 already added the
     broker-route + simulation guidance; we don't touch it.

The script is idempotent: re-running it leaves an already-enriched YAML
unchanged (idempotent at the per-field-example level, not just file-level
— each field example is regenerated from the same heuristics so the
output is deterministic).

Validation: after each YAML is rewritten, the schema validator runs
inline (per the v0.17.74 + v0.13.0 conventions). Failures abort with
the offending vendor printed.
