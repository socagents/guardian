# `scripts/` — maintainer research + build tooling

This directory contains **maintainer-side scripts**. They are NOT part of the customer-facing Phantom runtime, NOT installed on customer machines, and NOT triggered by any customer action.

**Repo-wide rules live in the [root CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)**. This file holds only conventions LOCAL to `scripts/`.

## What goes here, what does NOT

| Belongs in `scripts/` | Does NOT belong in `scripts/` |
|---|---|
| Research tools that harvest data once per upstream refresh | Anything that runs at customer install/upgrade time |
| YAML/bundle builders that produce committed artifacts | Anything customers' running stack imports at runtime |
| One-shot migrations + cohort cleanups (e.g. `fix_v17_25_vendor_buckets.py`) | Service code (use `mcp/agent/`, `bundles/spark/mcp/`, `xlog/`) |
| Validation + audit checks run in CI (the validators that gate builds) | Tooling that bakes into a Docker image |

If a script is consumed by service-runtime code, the runtime code is broken. Refactor the dependency out.

## Modeling-rule extraction is RESEARCH, not pipeline (operator framing)

The operator clarified the architecture intent on 2026-05-25:

> *"Modeling rules are not built in upstream. This is a temporary way to get access to field data, and this is done once. From now on, it's not gonna be part of the pipeline of adding data sources to our marketplace. … So we download everything from data modelling rules. We check the field mapping. … But these are, like, time saving rules. They are not part of, like, a pipeline built in into Phantom. … This is just a research job to find raw field information."*

Concrete contract:

1. **The artifact runtime consumes** is `bundles/spark/data-sources/*/data_source.yaml` (vendor-faithful field schemas + descriptions). Plus the `bundles/spark/connectors/cortex-content/baked/` tree for logos and pack metadata. Both are committed to git, baked into the agent image at CI build time.

2. **The path to producing those YAMLs** runs through `scripts/`:
   - `fetch_demisto_modeling_rules.py` — fetches upstream demisto/content
   - `extract_xif_alter_intermediates.py` — parses .xif modeling-rule files for regex `extract` patterns to discover vendor-emitted field names
   - `extract_cortex_fields_into_yamls.py` — reads cortex schema.json + writes per-pack `fields[]`
   - `refresh_cortex_baked_catalog.py` — rebakes the baked tree (logos, manifest)
   - `migrate_missing_packs.py` — fills gaps when upstream adds new packs
   - `fix_v17_25_vendor_buckets.py` — one-shot cohort cleanups (a la v0.17.27)

3. **The runtime never re-runs these scripts.** No "live" XSIAM/demisto fetch from a customer install. Customer downloads the agent image; image has baked YAMLs; runtime reads YAMLs. Period.

4. **Modeling rules are time-saving research, not engineering.** Adding a new vendor data source does NOT require a modeling rule to exist anywhere. The minimum is hand-curated `data_source.yaml` with the right `fields[]`. Modeling rules are just a shortcut for harvesting those `fields[]` at scale from public Cortex / Splunk / Sentinel / Elastic content.

If you add a new vendor and there's no modeling rule available, you hand-curate the YAML from vendor docs. If a modeling rule IS available, you use the extraction script to bootstrap. Either way the YAML is the only thing runtime cares about.

## Cross-vendor research backlog

The same extract-fields-from-public-content approach applies to vendors beyond Cortex. Future research targets in priority order:

| Source | What to extract | Tool sketch | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Splunk** | Public Splunk app + addon `props.conf` + `transforms.conf` files declare `EXTRACT-*`, `REPORT-*`, `FIELDALIAS-*` → reveals raw fields per vendor | Crawl `https://splunkbase.splunk.com/` listings, download apps, parse `default/props.conf` | TODO |
| **Elastic / Sentinel** | ECS data streams + Sentinel data connectors specify ingestion mappings | Public ECS YAML at `github.com/elastic/integrations/` / Sentinel data connectors at `github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/` | TODO |
| **Vendor official docs** | Many vendors publish field reference tables (FortiGate field reference, Palo Alto LogFormat reference, etc.) | Per-vendor scraper or LLM-assisted extraction | partial (Phase 4 vendor-doc fallback ran for top 30 in v0.16.0) |
| **Logstash / Beats** | Filebeat + Logstash community grok patterns reveal raw fields for syslog vendors | github.com/logstash-plugins/, elastic/beats | TODO |

When inventorying a new source:

1. Add the research script under `scripts/` (e.g. `scripts/research/extract_splunk_props_fields.py`).
2. The script's OUTPUT is a delta against existing `data_source.yaml` files — either patches existing YAMLs (more `fields[]`, sourced from Splunk addon) or creates new ones for vendors we don't yet cover.
3. Write the changes to `bundles/spark/data-sources/*/data_source.yaml`, commit, ship as a normal release.
4. **Do not** add Splunk/Elastic/Sentinel as a runtime dependency. Runtime only ever reads our YAMLs.

## How to tell whether a new script belongs here

Ask: *"Does a customer install ever run this code?"*

- **No** → `scripts/`. Documentation what the output is and where it lands in the runtime tree.
- **Yes** → NOT `scripts/`. Pick the right runtime module: `mcp/agent/`, `bundles/spark/mcp/`, `bundles/spark/connectors/<id>/`, or `xlog/`.

If the answer is *"only if the operator runs it manually"* — still `scripts/`. Operator-invoked maintenance ≠ customer-runtime.

## Script catalogue (as of v0.17.27)

| Script | Purpose | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| `refresh_cortex_baked_catalog.py` | Re-bake `bundles/spark/connectors/cortex-content/baked/` from upstream demisto/content | Manual, ~quarterly |
| `fetch_demisto_modeling_rules.py` | Download .xif modeling rules from demisto/content | Manual, paired with refresh |
| `extract_xif_alter_intermediates.py` | Parse .xif files for regex `extract` patterns to harvest vendor field names | Paired with refresh |
| `extract_cortex_fields_into_yamls.py` | Walk cortex schema.json + write per-pack `fields[]` into YAMLs | Paired with refresh |
| `migrate_bundled_packs_to_yaml.py` | One-shot v0.13.0 migration of bundled packs to YAML format | Done; archived |
| `migrate_missing_packs.py` | Idempotent: add YAML for any baked pack we don't yet cover | Run after each refresh |
| `fix_v17_25_vendor_buckets.py` | One-shot cohort cleanup of vendor bucketing + is_rawlog_only flags from v0.17.25 migration | Done; archived |
| `extend_data_source_fields.py` | Phase 4: vendor-doc field augmentation for top 30 vendors | Done; archived |
| `source_vendor_svgs.py` | Generate `vendor_svgs/<vk>_light.svg` files for the baked tree | Manual, when adding vendor logos |
| `e2e_*.py` | End-to-end smoke harnesses (one-shot test orchestration) | Per-release, manual |
| `classify_transport_intent.py` | Categorize each bundled pack by transport (raw_log / raw_json / direct) | Paired with fetch |
| `categorize_pack_ingest.py` | Older transport-categorization variant (S1/S2/S4) — kept for reference | Paired with fetch |
| `organize_rules_by_dataset.py` | Group fetched PR+MR pairs by dataset name into `scripts/maintainer/rules_by_dataset/{raw_log_based,raw_json_based,direct_mapped}/<dataset>/` with per-dataset manifest documenting the operator-side broker-applet config required | Auto-called by fetch_demisto_modeling_rules.py |
| `validate_*.py`, `check_*.py` | CI validators (gate builds) | Auto, on every PR |

## `scripts/maintainer/rules_by_dataset/` — dataset-grouped rules + operator setup docs

After every fetch the rules are reorganized into per-dataset subfolders so the operator can see at a glance which packs require **manual broker-applet configuration** before simulated logs will land in the right Cortex dataset.

Three categories:

| Folder | Trigger | Operator setup |
|---|---|---|
| `raw_log_based/<dataset>/` | PR or MR references `_raw_log` | Operator must add a **Broker VM Syslog Applet** with the pack's `vendor` + `product` + a dedicated source port. Without this, simulated logs land in `unknown_unknown_raw` and the parsing rule never fires. |
| `raw_json_based/<dataset>/` | PR or MR references `_raw_json` | Operator must configure the XSIAM HTTP Collector with the matching vendor/product source tag. (Currently zero packs in this category from public content.) |
| `direct_mapped/<dataset>/` | Neither token referenced | Works via CEF auto-extraction OR HTTP-collector typed-column ingestion. Usually no extra setup beyond standard Cortex ingestion. |

Each per-dataset folder contains `parsing.xif`, `modeling.xif`, and `manifest.json`. The manifest's `operator_setup_notes` field carries the exact remediation text the operator needs to follow.

Scripts marked "Done; archived" stay in the repo as documentation of the migration that happened — they don't get re-run. Re-running them on a current tree should be a no-op (idempotent by design).

## A note on `validate_*.py` + `check_*.py`

These are the exception to the "maintainer-only" rule. They run in CI (per `.github/workflows/`) to gate PRs from landing broken state. They're still NOT customer-runtime — but they're not one-off either. Cadence: every push.
